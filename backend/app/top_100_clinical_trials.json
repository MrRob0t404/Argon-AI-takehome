The researchers central hypothesis is that a high EAA to NEAA ratio in a protein meal is related to higher anabolic response to the meal. The researchers also hypothesize that the type of NEAA in a protein meal also affects the anabolic capacity of the meal. The researchers rationale is that finding the amino acid composition of a meal that will maximally induce protein anabolism will guide novel nutritional approaches to prevent and treat sarcopenia, thereby reducing both overall economic burden and improving individual patient outcomes.","detailedDescription":"The study will be conducted in sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults, stratified into different age categories. A sip feeding model will be used as it is a good model to establish the anabolic capacity of meals. The researchers hypothesize that plant-based protein induces less protein anabolism, due to lower production of EAA and higher production of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) as compared to dairy protein. The NEAA kinetics will be different between the plant proteins as soy protein has relatively high levels of the NEAA arginine and Pea protein of aspartate/glutamate. The researchers results will guide future nutritional advice on replacing daily protein with plant-based proteins while keeping the overall effects on metabolism comparable for both the EAA and NEAA. The study will take place at the research facility of the Center for Translational Research on Aging and Longevity (CTRAL), Texas A\\&M University located in the Human Clinical Research Building ) affiliated with Texas A\\&M University. The study involves 1 screening visit of approx. 3 hours, and 4 study days. Some study procedures (e.g., body composition, skeletal muscle function, questionnaires) may be skipped if completed within the past 3 months at CTRAL. All data will be recorded in Case Report Form and stored in the Texas A\\&M REDCap System. Subjects will be asked to arrive in the fasted state on all study days. Fasting prior to screening is not required. On the screening day, body weight, height, and body composition by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be measured. In addition, The Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and skeletal muscle function tests will be assessed at the end of each screening visit. Each study visit will begin with vital signs. Before administration of the feeding or the tracer solution, baseline blood will be collected for measurement of the natural enrichment of metabolites. After the baseline sample is collected, feeding will begin and will be followed by tracers of several compounds that may be administered by IV pulse. Participants will receive the liquid nutritional supplement as sip feeds every 20 minutes for 5 hours. The liquid nutrition supplements will contain the following proteins: (1) 45g of whey protein (dairy based), (2) 45g of soy protein (plant based), (3) 45g of pea protein (plant based), or (4) Placebo (water). Participants will have the option of adding sugar free (SF) vanilla syrup, SF caramel syrup, or SF chocolate syrup to their meals."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Protein Metabolism"],"keywords":["Prandial","Sarcopenia","Plant protein","Animal protein"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Healthy male older adults","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dietary Supplement: Whey Protein Isolate 90%.

Will VR-NF show indications of being more effective than Virtual Reality-based therapy alone in reducing the severity of auditory hallucinations, improving daily functioning, and enhancing quality of life?\n\nResearchers will compare VR-NF to Virtual Reality-based therapy alone to evaluate therapy effectiveness.\n\nParticipants will be allocated to receive 7 sessions of either VR-NF or Virtual Reality-based therapy alone. All participants will undergo a thorough assessment at baseline, and at 12 weeks post-baseline.","detailedDescription":"Auditory hallucinations represent some of the most frequent and debilitating symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), affecting up to 80 % of individuals with SSD. Despite receiving treatment with antipsychotic medication, nearly one-third of these individuals continue to experience psychotic symptoms.\n\nVirtual Reality-based interventions have emerged to address the essential need for targeted and effective psychotherapeutic interventions for auditory hallucinations. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) has developed and tested a fully immersive Virtual Reality-based intervention, with preliminary results indicating that this approach is effective in mitigating the severity of auditory hallucinations.\n\nThe Neuro-VR study aims to improve the effectiveness of this Virtual Reality-based intervention by incorporating real-time EEG-based neurofeedback into the intervention. We expect that augmenting the VR-based intervention with EEG-based neurofeedback will improve both its tolerability and effectiveness by using individual neurophysiological responses to guide the intervention.\n\nThe primary objective of the pilot study is to evaluate whether the combination of Virtual Reality and EEG-based neurofeedback is a feasible and acceptable therapeutic approach for treating auditory hallucinations in SSD. A secondary objective is to investigate whether Virtual Reality combined with EEG-based neurofeedback provides indications of being superior to Virtual Reality alone in reducing severity of auditory hallucinations, improving daily functioning and enhancing quality of life in individuals with SSD.\n\nIf the pilot study is found successful it could pave the way for broader clinical trials to document the effect of augmenting Virtual Reality-based interventions with real-time feedback from neurophysiological responses. In the long run, this combined approach can be implemented in the mental health clinics to complement traditional treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Auditory Hallucinations","Schizophrenia"],"keywords":["Virtual Reality-based therapy","Schizophrenia","Auditory Hallucinations","Neurofeedback","EEG"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Virtual Reality based therapy added real-time EEG-based neurofeedback (VR-NF)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the experimental group undergo 7 sessions of a manualized virtual reality-based intervention added real-time EEG neurofeedback aiming to enhance the control and sense of power in relation to the dominant hallucinated voice.

The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and change in disease activity when ABBV-400 is given in combination with Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and a programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD1) inhibitor (Budigalimab) (AFLB) to adult participants to treat locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma (mGEA).\n\nABBV-400 and Budigalimab are investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of mGEA. Fluorouracil and Leucovorin are drugs approved for the treatment of mGEA. This study will be divided into two stages, with the first stage treating participants with increasing doses of ABBV-400 within the AFLB regimen until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious. Participants will then be randomized into groups called treatment arms where one group will receive fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). A further two treatment groups will receive AFLB, but with two optimized doses of ABBV-400 to allow for the best dose to be studied in the future. Approximately 180 adult participants with mGEA will be enrolled in the study in 51 sites worldwide.\n\nIn the dose escalation stage participants will be treated with increasing intravenous (IV) doses of ABBV-400 within the AFLB regimen until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious. In the dose optimization stage participants will be receive FOLFOX or receive AFLB, but with one of two optimized doses of ABBV-400The study will run for a duration of approximately 6 years.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric Adenocarcinoma","Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma","Esophageal Adenocarcinoma"],"keywords":["Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric Adenocarcinoma","Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma","Esophageal Adenocarcinoma","ABBV-400","ABBV-181","Budigalimab"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":180,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stage 1: Dose Escalation ABBV-400","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive escalating doses of ABBV-400 in combination with a fixed dose of fluorouracil, leucovorin and budigalimab as part of the approximately 6 year study duration.","interventionNames":["Drug: ABBV-400","Drug: Budigalimab","Drug: Fluorouracil","Drug: Leucovorin"]},{"label":"Stage 2 Arm 1: Dose Optimization ABBV-400 Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-400 dose A in combination with a fixed dose of fluorouracil, leucovorin and budigalimab as part of the approximately 6 year study duration.","interventionNames":["Drug: ABBV-400","Drug: Budigalimab","Drug: Fluorouracil","Drug: Leucovorin"]},{"label":"Stage 2 Arm 2: Dose Optimization ABBV-400 Dose B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ABBV-400 dose B in combination with a fixed dose of fluorouracil, leucovorin and budigalimab as part of the approximately 6 year study duration.","interventionNames":["Drug: ABBV-400","Drug: Budigalimab","Drug: Fluorouracil","Drug: Leucovorin"]},{"label":"Stage 2 Arm 3: Dose Optimization Standard of Care (SOC)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive a fixed dose of leucovorin (folinic acid), fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and budigalimab as part of the approximately 6 year study duration.","interventionNames":["Drug: Budigalimab","Drug: Fluorouracil","Drug: Leucovorin","Drug: Oxaliplatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ABBV-400","description":"Intravenous (IV) Infusion","armGroupLabels":["Stage 1: Dose Escalation ABBV-400","Stage 2 Arm 1: Dose Optimization ABBV-400 Dose A","Stage 2 Arm 2: Dose Optimization ABBV-400 Dose B"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Budigalimab","description":"IV Infusion","armGroupLabels":["Stage 1: Dose Escalation ABBV-400","Stage 2 Arm 1: Dose Optimization ABBV-400 Dose A","Stage 2 Arm 2: Dose Optimization ABBV-400 Dose B","Stage 2 Arm 3: Dose Optimization Standard of Care (SOC)"],"otherNames":["ABBV-181"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fluorouracil","description":"IV Infusion;

Diagnosis and treatment of the former two i.e., large-vessel coronary heart disease and endovascular thrombectomy of the brain in relation to stroke have improved significantly. Yet, the majority of elderly patients with ischemic heart disease do not have large-vessel heart disease and it seems that small vessel disease (SVD) may explain a large fraction of these cases as well as the cardiovascular morbidity in the elderly. Hence, the current development in diagnostics and treatments of ischemic heart disease does not address the most common subtype of ischemic disease seen in elderly patients.\n\nIt has been suggested that SVD is part of a multisystem disorder and several systematic reviews have addressed the hypothesis of a potential link between small vessel disease of the heart, brain, and kidneys. Cerebral SVD is prevalent in the aging population causing cognitive impairment, dementia, and an increased risk of stroke, and cerebral hypoperfusion is an acknowledged cause of vascular dementia and a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease. Further, cognitive impairment within multiple cognitive domains is highly prevalent in heart failure and is associated to an increased risk of dementia. The link between heart failure and dementia may be due to multisystem SVD, although a direct link between the two is possible.\n\nAmong other known risk factors such as age, hypertension, and female sex, diabetes is a major cause of SVD and is linked to coronary heart disease as well as cognitive impairment. The diagnosis of cerebral SVD relies on MRI detecting infarctions, haemorrhages, microbleeds and ischemic white matter changes, i.e. Fazekas score. In contrast, perfusion PET is used to image myocardial perfusion in patients with coronary SVD; and coronary SVD is recognized as a part of the pathophysiology in angina, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Perfusion PET before and after adenosine-induced vasodilation allows for measuring, the myocardial flow reserve (MFR), i.e. perfusion capacity, which in the absence of regional perfusion defects, is a measure of coronary SVD. Prof. Eva Prescott have recently shown that reduced MFR obtained by 82Rb PET is a strong predictor of future microvascular events and all-cause mortality.\n\nExercise is well known to improve cognitive health but professor Carl-Johan Boraxbekk has shown that the effect on cognitive performance may be dependent on the initial cerebrovascular status, as patients with moderate to severe white matter changes did not improve after a 6 months physical activation intervention in contrast to patients with mild changes. Yet, it is possible to improve brain function in diabetic patients through either dietary or exercise interventions.\n\nSystemic SVD is measured as cerebral SVD (reduced brain perfusion during acetazolamide-induced vasodilation) and coronary SVD (reduced heart perfusion during adenosine-induced vasodilation). The researchers anticipate that patients with type 2 dabetes have reduced perfusion capacity of the brain and heart correlating to reduced cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2-max).","detailedDescription":"The goal of this clinical trial is to compare baseline measurements relevant to microvascular disease between patients with diabetes and increased risk of microvascular disease with healthy age-matched control.\n\nThe researchers wish to examine if small vessel disease is a disease that affects several organs at once in the same individuals by examining it in the brain and heart in the same participants. The researchers will also test if cardiorespiratory conditioning (VO2-max), blood perfusion to the heart and brain and cognitive performance are correlated in patients with microvascular disease.\n\nTo adress these aims the researchers have defined the following assumptions that they will refute or confirm through this study:\n\n* Patients with type 2 diabetes and increased risk of small vessel disease have significantly reduced perfusion capacity of the brain and heart compared to healthy controls as part of a multisystem disease\n* Perfusion capacity of the brain and heart, the cardiorespiratory fitness level of the subjects and cognitive performance are directly linked.\n\n  48 patients with diabetes and 24 healthy age-matched controls will undergo baseline testing that include:\n* Cardiopulmonal Exercise Test (CPET) to determine cardiopulmonal conditioning (VO2-max)\n* Isometric knee strength (if logistically possible)\n* Echocardiography\n* Blood perfusion capacity of the heart and brain via \\[15O\\]H2O-PET scans\n* Brain MRI to determine structural damages\n* Blood samples for basic health check (relevant to inclusion, exclusion and safety) and blood samples looking at endothelial and neurological damage for a biobank\n* Cognitive testing (SCIP-D and CANTAB)\n\nAfterwards the researchers will compare the results between the two groups and see if there is a correlation between VO2-max, blood perfusion to the heart and brain and cognitive performance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Microvascular Disease","Microvascular Complications","Dementia","Diabetes Mellitus Type 2","Cerebral Hypoperfusion"],"keywords":["microvascular disease","microvascular complications of the heart","microvascular complications of the brain","diabetes type 2","dementia","microvascular disease patophysiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"We will keep bllod samples in a Biobank.

Patients who receive steroid injections for conditions like back pain or arthritis experience temporary high blood sugar (called steroid-induced hyperglycemia, SIH), which can sometimes lead to complications, especially in patients with diabetes. This study aims to understand this by monitoring blood glucose levels using continuous glucose monitors (Dexcom G7). The main goal of this study is to track how steroid injections impact blood sugar levels in patients.","detailedDescription":"Steroid injections are frequently used in pain management for conditions such as arthritis, back pain, and joint inflammation. While effective at reducing pain and inflammation, these steroids can cause temporary spikes in blood sugar, known as steroid-induced hyperglycemia. This can be a concern, especially for patients with diabetes, as poorly managed high blood sugar can lead to serious complications. This study aims to explore the effects of three commonly used steroids: dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and triamcinolone, each administered at different doses. Participants will be fitted with a Dexcom G7 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) on their arm, which will track their blood sugar levels every 5 minutes for up to 10 days.\n\nThe study's primary objective is to determine how often steroid-induced hyperglycemia occurs, how severe it is, and how long it lasts. Study will also investigate whether certain factors-such as the type of steroid, dosage, or the patient's underlying conditions-affect blood sugar responses. Additionally, the study will assess how the use of the CGM device may improve overall patient care, reduce the need for emergency interventions, and potentially lower healthcare costs by preventing complications.\n\nBy gathering high-resolution glucose data, this research will provide valuable insights into the best practices for managing blood sugar in patients receiving steroid injections.

Most preterm newborns require Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) care depending on their gestational age and clinical condition. Although many painful invasive procedures are usually performed on newborns in the NICU, the most common procedure is heel prick. Heel prick is a painful and stressful procedure for the newborn. Neonates do not respond to pain verbally; they respond physiologically, behaviorally and hormonally. Physiologic responses of preterm infants to pain include increased heart and respiratory rate, increased blood pressure and intracranial pressure, decreased oxygenation, and sweating of palms. Among the hormonal symptoms caused by stress in newborns, the most commonly used biochemical method is the measurement of cortisol level. It is reported that there is a significant correlation between salivary and plasma cortisol levels and salivary cortisol level reflects plasma cortisol level. This method is particularly preferred because saliva sampling is much less stressful.","detailedDescription":"Health professionals should be able to evaluate pain, reduce or eliminate pain in pain management of neonates in interventional applications. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods are used in pain management. When these methods are applied together, their effectiveness increases in pain related to invasive interventions. Pharmacologically, opioid analgesics, sedatives and local anesthetics are used. Nonpharmacologic methods include breastfeeding, pacifier, oral sucrose, music, warm application, massage, therapeutic touch and positioning such as nesting, fetal positioning, swaddling, kangaroo care, rocking and holding.\n\nIn many studies, nonpharmacologic interventions have been applied and compared to reduce pain during heel prick in preterm newborns. In the routine of the clinic, heel prick blood collection from preterm newborns is performed by hugging the mother in her lap. The swaddling procedure for preterm newborns in the control group is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The swaddling method supports flexion and lateral posture, which is the developmental position of the newborn. With this position, the newborn comes to its position in the uterus, which is familiar to it, ensuring its physiological stability and improving its capacity. In a systematic review of 3396 participants, preterm newborns were calmed and immediately stabilized by kangaroo care, non-nutritive sucking and swaddling methods. Since these methods reduce pain and stress in preterm newborns, they are also reported to be included in \"Individualized Supportive Developmental Care\" practices.\n\nMany studies have shown that giving pacifiers to newborns is effective in reducing pain. In addition, oral administration of breast milk alone, without breastfeeding, has been found to reduce pain during heel prick, nasopharyngeal aspiration, venipuncture and retinopathy examination in preterms. In the study conducted by Lan et al., breast milk was sniffed to the newborn during heel prick blood collection or tasted by dropping into the newborns mouth with a syringe. As a result, they reported that sniffing and plus tasting breast milk was effective in alleviating pain in newborns.\n\nIn the literature, it is emphasized that the pain that occurs during heel blood collection is closely related to the squeezing of the heel to collect blood, not during the needle insertion into the heel, and it is thought that keeping the newborn in an upright position during heel blood collection may facilitate blood flow through gravity and reduce the amount of squeezing required to obtain the sample. However, there are studies showing that heel warming is effective in reducing pain in newborns. It has been stated that with warm application to the heel -with the effect of vasodilation- fewer needling is performed in the heel, the amount of blood required for the procedure increases and the procedure is completed in a shorter time. It is predicted that the heel of the newborn will be squeezed less thanks to the warm application.\n\nHowever, there is a very limited number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of different nonpharmacologic interventions during heel prick blood collection and measuring the stress marker cortisol. In addition, no study was found to investigate the effectiveness of other interventions (heel warming and giving a pacifier dipped in breast milk) in combination with wrapping among nonpharmacological interventions.\n\nThis study aimed to reduce pain during heel prick blood collection in preterm newborns by swaddling the baby in the mothers lap (control group), swaddling in the mothers lap together with giving a pacifier dipped in breast milk (pacifier with breast milk group), swaddling in the mother;s lap together with local dry heat application (heel heating group), and all interventions combined (swaddling in the mother;s lap together with giving a pacifier dipped in breast milk and heel heating-combined intervention group). In addition, it was planned as a randomized controlled experimental design to determine and compare the effects of these nursing interventions on the newborns physiological parameters, pain, salivary cortisol level, crying and procedure time.\n\nPlace and Time to Conduct the Research:\n\nThe research will be carried out between November 2024 and August 2025 in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Tekirdag Namik Kemal University Hospital.\n\nPopulation and Sample of the Study:\n\nThe study population will consist of infants who meet the inclusion criteria in the NICU of Tekirdağ Namik Kemal University between 01.11.2024-01.08.2025.\n\nThe sample size of the study was determined by power analysis. The study comparing non-nutritive suction, sucrose and combination interventions in heel prick blood collection in newborns with the control group was taken as a basis. According to the PIPP pain assessment scale used in the study, the 1st experimental group had a mean score of 9.3 ± 1.3, the 2nd experimental group 10.1 ± 2, the 3rd group 4.4 ± 1.5, and the control group 13.3 ± 1.6. In this study, it was determined that a total of 88 infants (22 in each group) should be included in the study in the sample number calculation made in the G\\*Power (3.1.9.2.) program with a 5% alpha margin of error (two-way) and 80% power, predicting that the PIPP score mean difference would have a large effect size (.95 large effect) (the effect size was found to be 2.74).\n\nRandomization:\n\nThe sample will be randomly selected from the study population. In the study, randomization of premature newborns will be performed in a computer environment. The newborns to be subjected to heel prick blood collection were placed in groups with a randomized controlled method with 18 babies in each group.

However, its major receptors are also found in the brain, particularly in areas implicated in anxiety and depression. In line with this topography, drugs blocking angiotensin-II receptors have been shown to have effects on cognition that are opposite to those seen in emotional disorders. For instance, angiotensin receptor blockade improves fear extinction, and it dampens stress responsivity to highly aversive images. In line with such cognitive effects, population-based studies suggest that angiotensin receptor blockers - compared to other antihypertensive drugs - prevent the development of post-traumatic stress disorder following trauma exposition and improve outcomes in patients taking SSRI.\n\nThis study aims to shed further light on how the renin-angiotensin system affects different aspects of cognitive processing in humans relevant to emotional disorders. In a double-blind, randomized between-group design, we will investigate the effects of a single dose of losartan (50mg) versus placebo on emotional processing in N=60 healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years. Results from this study will help us understand how the renin-angiotensin system affects emotional processing in humans, and they will help us identify potential synergistic overlaps with the cognitive mechanisms of action of effective treatment of emotional disorders."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Emotional Processing"],"keywords":["emotional processing","reward","anxiety","depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel randomised experimental medicine trial","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"double-blind","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"losartan","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"oral single-dose losartan potassium (Cozaar; 50mg)","interventionNames":["Drug: Losartan potassium 50mg"]},{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Microcellulose placebo in identical capsule","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Losartan potassium 50mg","description":"Single dose losartan (50 mg, weight-adjusted), encapsulated identically to placebo","armGroupLabels":["losartan"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Single tablet encapsulated identically to losartan","armGroupLabels":["placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reinforcement Learning","description":"reinforcement learning, calculated as the learning rate from aversive and appetitive decision outcomes.

Participants will be asked to answer a questionnaire regarding their age, race/ethnicity, smoking history, and residential history if they have ever been told they have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), high blood pressure, education level, medications and height and weight. Participants will then be asked to give a breath sample via the breath collection device. All this information will be collected before the breath collection. After that, participants will give 1-2 tablespoons of blood. CT scans with IPN(s) will be reviewed and run through a computer detection software to identify nodules, followed up as per current clinical guidelines.","detailedDescription":"Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death in Canada and worldwide. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening has been shown to be a cost-effective measure to save lives in people who have smoked heavily based on several large randomized control trials. The evidence led to the implementation of LDCT lung cancer screening in Canada for people who have smoked heavily in the past or are still smoking. However, over 50% of patients who develop lung cancer today would not meet current screening eligibility criteria. A strategy to identify individuals who are not currently eligible for screening but are at high risk for lung cancer is urgently needed. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that patients with incidental pulmonary nodules (IPNs), often do not meet LDCT screening criteria. These patients despite having a higher risk of lung cancer, the majority are never followed up in the clinical setting. This represents an important opportunity to address the emerging challenge for lung cancer early detection while addressing the missing link between IPNs and lung cancer.\n\nObjective.\n\nOur proposed study will have two important goals: (a) identify people at high risk of lung cancer who would benefit from LDCT screening but are currently ineligible; (b) provide the framework to manage patients with Incidental Pulmonary Nodules with appropriate follow-up based on accurate interpretation of the chest CT scan that is already available.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\n(i) Develop the framework to assess the lung cancer risk of IPN patients; (ii) Develop and validate an exhaled breath test to identify high-risk individuals who do not meet current eligibility criteria for LDCT screening; (iii) Prospectively validate a panel of circulating blood proteins to personalize the management of incidental pulmonary nodules; (iv) Improve the accuracy and consistency of reading chest CT scans with incidental pulmonary nodules to improve lung cancer early detection; (v) Evaluate the health-economic benefits of a multi-modal approach to the management of incidental pulmonary nodules\n\nMethods. In total, there will be 3600 participants recruited between both arms of the study.\n\nAs IPN patients represent a high-risk, screening ineligible and usually under-served population, we will establish a multi-provincial IPN cohort based on 3600 patients with IPNs from 3 provinces: British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. For the Breathomics, we will conduct a comprehensive investigation of volatile organic compounds using state-of-the-art technology, and high-resolution accurate mass gas chromatography spectrometry. The breath signatures will be validated using pre-diagnostic breath samples in the IPN cohort and test the clinical utility with a point-of-care mobile device. We will validate the circulating protein panel prospectively and assess the absolute risk of lung cancer in the IPN cohort to establish the risk thresholds for clinical application. In parallel, we will develop a deep learning algorithm based on LDCT images to improve the classification of IPN. A health economic analysis will be performed on the clinical utility of these tools.\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe IPN population provides an untapped learning opportunity for us to improve lung cancer early detection. Identification of individuals who are not currently eligible for screening but are at high risk of lung cancer allows us to utilize artificial intelligence and other biomarkers to predict lung cancer from an already available single chest CT that is already available."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Pulmonary Nodule"],"keywords":["Volatile Organic Compounds","CT Scan","Screening","Biomarkers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Incidental Pulmonary Nodule Arm","type":"OTHER","description":"Nodule Follow up as per Fleischner Guidelines","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Chest CT Scan"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Chest CT Scan","description":"Chest CT Scan","armGroupLabels":["Incidental Pulmonary Nodule Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Develop the framework to assess the lung cancer risk of Incidental Pulmonary Nodule patients","description":"Aim 1: Develop the framework within the Canadian context to promote the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancert hat can work synergistically with organized lung cancer screening programs to improve outcome of patients with lung cancer, using IPN population as a learning example.\n\n1.

It is regarded as a significant opportunistic human pathogen.\n\nThis bacterium become a growing problem in hospitals as a predominant multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterium. Horizontal acquisition of resistance genes is the main factor involved in the emergence of MDR .\n\nThere are many mechanisms to confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics in A. baumannii, one of them is multidrug efflux pumps. These efflux pumps are important source of MDR, which export antibiotics from the cell, increasing their antibiotic resistance.\n\nAdeABC is one of the most important efflux systems, belonging to the RND family in Acinetobacter, which plays an important role in the resistance to a broad group of antibiotics; its genes are chromosomal and encode three genes, i.e., AdeB, AdeA, and AdeC, forming an operon in the vicinity. In addition, the expression of AdeABC is done by a two-component system, which includes a response regulator (AdeR) and a sensor kinase (AdeS) .\n\nThe ability of Acinetobacter spp. to form biofilm that enables bacterial survival in hospital settings, especially in ICUs, is the most significant contributing factor to their virulence, and this trait is also responsible for their notable antibiotic resistance. Several biofilm-related genes influence antimicrobial susceptibility, suggesting an association between the biofilm-forming ability of Acinetobacter spp. and their antibiotic resistance patterns (MDR/XDR)\n\nZinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are one of the most important nanoparticles of metal oxides; it is a unique and inorganic materials that can be used in several biological applications (anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory). ZnO NPs exhibit distinctive properties other than other nanoparticles such as higher solubility, better biofilm penetration and effective drug delivery . ZnO NPs have been reported to have antimicrobial properties such as disrupting the cell membrane of pathogens, accumulating in the cell and producing toxic H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Infections, Nosocomial","Infections, Respiratory Tract"],"keywords":["A. baumannii.","Biofilm","ZnO NPs","hospital aquired infections"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Different samples (pus, urine, urinary catheter samples, wound swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and central venous catheter samples) will be collected under strict aseptic precautions from patients admitted at different departments at Sohag university hospitals"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Culture specific antibiotic therapy","description":"Samples will be cultured on MacConkey agar.

Secondary, the project will provide information regarding effects on cardiovascular disease risk-factors, functional capacity, quality of life, satisfaction, and cost through a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) including individuals with MDs.\n\nOutcomes assessed in this project, such as maximal oxygen uptake, functional capacity, and quality of life, are strongly related to the ability to carry out activities of daily living. These outcomes are associated with benefits such as reduced sick leave, extended life expectancy, independence, and improved health status with increasing age. Economically, with the world population growing older and health care resources being stretched, there is clearly a need to apply and evaluate effective alternative methods to improve somatic health on a broader scale in a sustainable fashion, preferably utilizing existing platforms and exercise apps.","detailedDescription":"The main aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate if digital exercise followup can support exercise adherence and result in increased aerobic capacity in individuals with MDs. We will assess the short-term effects through a 12-week intervention, and its long-term effects after 1-year. Both the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) will receive two sessions of aerobic interval training at the Exercise Training Clinic, situated at the Department of Psychosis and Rehabilitation, Psychiatry Clinic, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. One training session consists of 36 minutes of high intensity training (HIT). HIT consists of 4x4 intervals on a treadmill at 85-95% of maximal heart rate, interspersed by 3minute active rest periods at 70% maximal heart rate \\[31\\]. Following the educational exercise sessions at the Exercise Training Clinic, the IG will be encouraged to perform two aerobic interval training sessions per week for 12 weeks, on their own and not at the exercise training clinic, while receiving digital follow-up support through HelsaMi and exercise guidance through the exercise app. The digital follow-up through HelsaMi will consist of overview of treatment progress and schedule, communication with health care personnel (video consultation or chat up to 2 times per week), notifications reminding them to exercise, exercise diary, questionnaires, and educational content.\n\nObjective. To investigate if digital exercise follow-up through HelsaMi combined with an exercise app (Myworkout GO) in individuals with MDs is more effective at improving exercise adherence and aerobic capacity compared to standard treatment coupled with advice on how to perform high intensity interval training without any digital follow-up.\n\nMain hypothesis. Digital follow-up of exercise yields better results than only being advised to exercise at improving exercise adherence, peak oxygen uptake (V̇ O2peak), work efficiency, functional capacity, and quality of life after 12 weeks and 1-year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Mental Disorder"],"keywords":["Peak oxygen uptake","Aerobic high-intensity interval training","Digital follow-up","Mental health disorder","Exercise physiology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomized at a 1:1 allocation ratio into an Intervention Group or Control Group.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Participants are aware of which group they are assigned to."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will be encouraged to perform two aerobic interval training sessions per week for 12 weeks, on their own and not at the exercise training clinic, while receiving digital follow-up support through HelsaMi and exercise guidance through the exercise app. The digital follow-up through HelsaMi will consist of overview of treatment progress and schedule, communication with health care personnel (video consultation or chat up to 2 times per week), notifications reminding them to exercise, exercise diary, questionnaires, and educational content.","interventionNames":["Other: Intervention group/training group"]},{"label":"Control gorup","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"This group will be encouraged to perform the same exercise training but without any follow-up support"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Intervention group/training group","description":"We will assess the short-term effects through a 12-week intervention, and its long-term effects after 1-year.

Secondary objectives include comparing the time to complete haemostasis, discharge eligibility, incidence of adverse events, and patient comfort between the two techniques.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomly assigned to receive either the StatSeal device or the figure-of-eight suture after their AF ablation procedure. The study will recruit 160 participants across multiple hospital sites, with 80 participants in each group.

Usually heavy bupivacaine ....mg (2.5ml) with fentanyl ...mg (ml) is administered.\n\nAfter the operation, patients are brought to PACU where the nurses monitor vitals and transfer them to postoperative wards once patients are awake and hemodynamically stable.\n\nStudy populations:\n\nWomen undergoing elective cesarean section in JDW National Referral Hospital\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAll elective cesarean sections performed under spinal anesthesia, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification II (ASA II).\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nThose mothers underwent emergency cesarean section, contraindication to spinal anesthesia (increased intracranial pressure, coagulopathy, or local skin infection), hypersensitivity to any of the drugs used in the study, failed spinal anesthesia converted to general anesthesia, pre-existing pain syndromes, or with a history of recent opioid exposure, significant cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease, and fetal abnormalities or negative fetal outcomes were excluded from the study.\n\nStudy period:\n\nThe study was carried out from 1st January 2023 till 31st December 2023\n\nSample size:\n\nThe sample size was calculated using the G\\*Power version 3.1.97 with the following imputations- Test family: 't' tests; Statistical test: 'Mean' differences between two independent means (two groups); Type of power analysis: A priori, computer required sample size. Input parameters: two-tailed test, Type I error (α) = 0.05; Type II error (β) = 0.2; Power = 1-β = 0.8, allocation ratio N2/N1 = 1, and with an effect size (dz) 0.6. The total sample size (n) obtained was 90.\n\nA drop-out rate of 10% was expected, and the total sample taken for the study was 100, divided equally into two groups TAP (n=50) and WI (n=50).\n\nStudy Procedure:\n\nAn ethical clearance was obtained from the Research Ethical Board of Health, Ministry of Health, Bhutan with Ref No: IRB/Approval/PN/2022-018/ 445, dated 10th November 2022.\n\nAll the pregnant mothers posted for elective CS were approached in the pre-operative room by the investigators and obtained written informed consent to participate in the study. Those mothers who voluntarily consented were recruited to the study after applying the inclusion criteria. Those mothers were briefed and familiarised with the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain scores.\n\nRandomization:\n\nAfter recruitment, they were allocated into two groups, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and local wound infiltration (WI) consisting of 50 participants in each group. Allocation into two groups was done following a lottery system of randomization where each participant was made to pick up one from the basket containing 100 enclosed envelopes which consisted of 50 each for TAP and WI.\n\nBlinding:\n\nA single-blinded study was conducted where the study participants did not know which intervention they received.\n\nIn the operating room, patients were attached to anesthetic machines and monitored non-invasively for blood pressure, pulse rate, saturation, and electrocardiogram. All the patients were given intravenous crystalloid solution (Ringers Lactate) at a standard rate. Spinal anesthesia consisting of a preservative-free hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine of 1.8ml - 2.2ml was administered intrathecally at the L3 - L4 level using a 27G spinal needle. Failed spinal anesthesia and those converted to general anesthesia were excluded from the study.\n\nAfter attaining an upper sensory level of T6 or higher, a standard CS with a Pfannenstiel incision was performed by the resident under supervision or by a consultant obstetrician. After the delivery of the baby, participants in both groups received oxytocin (30 units) through infusion and intravenous paracetamol (15mg/kg). Intraoperative complications were managed following the same protocol for both groups; bradycardia and hypotension were treated with inj ephedrine (....), and nausea/vomiting were managed inj metoclopramide (10mg).\n\nIntervention:\n\nIn the TAP group, after completion of CS, the anesthesiologist performed a bilateral TAP block. The dividing screen was kept in place and the skin was cleaned with a 10% betadine solution. Under sterile precautions, using a linear ultrasound probe placed over the mid-axillary line at the midpoint between the costal margin and the iliac crest, the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles were identified. A 20 G nerve block needle was advanced under direct ultrasound vision through the skin, subcutaneous tissues, external oblique, and internal oblique, and once the needle tip reached the space between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscle, a 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected. A well-defined, hypoechoic, elliptical shape formation confirmed the correct site of injection. The same procedure was performed on the other side.\n\nIn Group WI, the local anesthetic wound infiltration was performed by the operating obstetrician. Before the skin closure, 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected subcutaneously along the full length including both the upper and lower margins of the wound. The dividing screen was kept in place so the patient could not determine which pain intervention was being offered to them.\n\nAfter the intervention following CS, participants were taken to the PACU and monitored for vitals. In the PACU, pain scores were assessed using the VAS by the investigators, and the postoperative complications including nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and the additional medications required in the PACU were recorded.\n\nAfter they were shifted to the maternity ward, trained maternity nurses who were not a part of the study and unaware of the treatment modality, monitored and recorded the pain score, opioid consumption, and side effects at 6, 12, and 24 hours according to the questionnaire that was handed in the patient's file. Postoperative rescue analgesia was given according to the standard institute obstetricians protocol with scheduled oral paracetamol and intramuscular diclofenac sodium injections with on demand opioids (pethidine/tramadol/morphine). Ondansetron intravenous was offered for nausea and vomiting.\n\nStudy end-points:\n\nPrimary end-point was opioids consumption in the first 24hour after cesarean section.\n\nSecondary end-point was VAS pain score (0-10) and side effects like post operative nausea, vomiting, sedation, and complications related to the procedure.\n\nData analysis:\n\nData were double-entered and validated using EpiData (version 3.1 for entry and version 2.2.2.183 for analysis, EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark). Data were exported and analyzed using SPSS (version 23). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to test for the normality of the study data. Normally distributed continuous demographic and clinical characteristics variables were compared using student t-test. Non-normally distributed two independent variables were compared using Mann-Whitney test. The Chi square or Fisher's exact test was used to analyze categorical variables and presented in frequencies and percentages. The p-value of \\&lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant in the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block","Wound Infiltration","Pain Score (VAS)","Opioid Analgesia"],"keywords":["transversus abdominis plane block","Wound infiltration of local anesthesia","pain score","Opioid analgesia","cesarean section"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TAP group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Local anesthesia 0.25% bupivacine 20ml was administered at the transversus abdominis plane in TAP group (experiment)","interventionNames":["Procedure: TAP group"]},{"label":"WI group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Local anesthesia 0.25% bupivacine 20ml was administered or infiltrated along the cesarean wound in WI group as a an active comparator","interventionNames":["Procedure: TAP group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"TAP group","description":"Local anesthesia 0.25% bupivacine was administered in the TAP plane","armGroupLabels":["TAP group","WI group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To compare cumulative consumption of opioids in the first 24 hours after cesarean section","description":"Cumulative use of Inj. morphine during the postoperative period was significantly less in the TAP group than in the WI group (5.4 ± 0.9 Vs 6.1 ± 0.6, p=0.017)","timeFrame":"within 24 hours postoperative period"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To compare the pain score using the Visual Analogue Scale between the intervention (TAP) and comparator (WI) group","description":"The postoperative pain score was significantly lower in the intervention (TAP) group where patients received ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block as compared to a comparative (WI) group who received wound infiltration of local anesthesia (0.62 ± 0.87 Vs 1.22 ± 1.44 respectively, p-value 0.013) at the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).","timeFrame":"within 6, 12 and 24 hours postoperative period"},{"measure":"To compare the postoperative complications between the intervention (TAP) group with the comparator (WI) group.","description":"Postoperative complications were reported in over 15% (15/99) of the patients.

The response to the FC is due to several physiological conditions related to the \"preload dependency\" (i.e. the intrinsic ability of the heart of increasing the stroke volume - SV - in response to fluid administration).\n\nThe minimal volume required to appropriately \"challenge\" the cardiovascular system is 4 ml/kg of fluid, but higher volumes (up to 6 ml/kg may be needed).\n\nPredicting the response to FC administration may be possible by applying a physiological test (called functional hemodynamic test), such as the end-expiratory occlusion test, consisting in interrupping the mechanical ventilation and hence promoting venous return and consequente SV changes. The percentage of SV increase associated to EEOT may predict fluid responsiveness to the FC (patients responders will increase SV to a bigger extent, as compared to non-responders)","detailedDescription":"A two-step statistical approach will be used to define the best model to predict the fluid responsiveness.\n\n1. A univariable logistic regression model to test the association of the considered hemodynamic variables provided by the hemodynamic monitoring with the primary outcome (fluid responsiveness at 10th minute). Then a multivariable analysis incorporating the variable in univariable analysis with a p \\< 0.2, after testing the colinearity and interactions. Significance threshold for multivariable analysis will be set to 0.05\n2. A Hosmer and Lemeshow test was calculated to evaluate goodness of fit for the logistic regression model, the Informative criterion metrics, such as Akaike Infromation Criterion, AIC) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve \\[standard error, (SE)\\] analysis evaluated the performance of predictive items for FC response (i.e.Y = dependent variable =SVI increasedby ≥ 10%) 10 minutes (Y10) after FC infusion. The absence of a significant increase in the likelihood value afteromission of each of the remaining variables was checked.\n\nTo define the best model to predict the amount of fluid in responder group a machine-learning approach will be considered where Y = dependent variable = total amount of crystalloids to obtained SVI ≥ 10% after FC infusion, X = matrix of parameters. The final model decision will be made among following commonly used regression algorithms: linear reagression, Lasso Regression or Ridge Regression. The model performance assessment will be made using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared. K-fold cross-validation technique will be applied to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n\nThe hemodynamic values of responders and non-responders at each step of the protocol are analyzed with a one -way analysis of variance for repeated measurements (ANOVA) and Geisser -Greenhouse (G-G) correction as ajustement for lack of sphericity if needed. Post-hoc pairwise multiple comparisons analysis are performed using Tukey's test to control familywise error.\n\nTo understand whether hemodynamic changes after EEOT could help in the prediction of minimal dose of FC the study will enroll 2-year evaluable patients, and the final numer will be foreseen in about 300, with aroud 500 fluid challenge.\n\nThe sample size will allow us to perform three step:\n\n4. an initial step of 50 patients to understand which variables of hemodynamic changes after EEOT will affect the minimal dose of FC.

Our multi-PI team proposes a two-arm RCT called ADEPT-ICU (Attenuating DEPression with Internet CBT to Slow Cognitive Decline in Older ICU Survivors), which will test the efficacy of an internet CBT intervention called Good Days Ahead (GDA) to reduce the burden of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in older ICU survivors with moderate to severe depressive symptoms after ICU hospitalization.","detailedDescription":"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect 47 million people worldwide with an annual global cost of $818 billion. The risk of developing ADRD is disproportionately borne by older adults with multiple chronic conditions from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (URGs). One such high risk group is older survivors of critical illness who were admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs). Nearly half of ICU survivors experience subjective cognitive decline(SCD), i.e., perceived decline in memory and thinking even with normal objective cognitive data. With over 5 million adult ICU admissions in the US each year, an intervention reducing SCD in older ICU survivors could significantly prevent or lower the incidence of ADRD. Thus, there is an urgent need for an inclusive randomized controlled trial (RCT) to rigorously test whether a novel, accessible, and scalable intervention can reduce SCD in a diverse cohort of older ICU survivors. One potential target for such interventions is post-ICU depression, which affects about one-third of ICU survivors. To date, there are no large scale RCTs which have rigorously tested whether depression focused psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), reduce SCD in a diverse cohort of older ICU survivors with depression.\n\nWe propose a two-arm, randomized, parallel-group, assessor-blinded clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of internet CBT for depression compared to an active control in reducing SCD and slowing cognitive decline in older ICU survivors with post-ICU depression.

Interventions: Three training programs: continuous aerobic in kayak, aerobic resistance circuit, and high-intensity interval with rope. The main measures to be explored will be the potential effects of training on heart rate variability as an indicator of autonomic function; measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2max) and resting metabolic unit (METs) for cardiovascular fitness; bone density examination (DXA) for body composition, metabolic profile, functional independence and life satisfaction in individuals with SCI.\n\nResults: The 8-week training program will increase METs and VO2max, improve heart rate variability and anthropometric variables, body composition, and metabolic profile","detailedDescription":"Background The increased overall cardiovascular risk could have some causes, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN), higher BMI, higher waist-to-hip ratio, or deterioration in physical fitness. Obesity and diabetes have been shown to be comparatively higher among people with SCI. An additional factor that contributes to the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in SCI is sedentary lifestyle and reduced physical function associated with the loss of motor function, and the interruption of normal autonomic cardiovascular control mechanisms.\n\nIt is increasingly recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD); elevated reactive C protein (RCP) levels are independently associated with increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and cardiovascular events. In turn, the higher degree of dyslipidemia found in the population with SCI contributes significantly to this risk. Abnormal lipids are generally modifiable with changes in physical activity and diet along with the use of statins. Numerous studies in people with diabetes have unequivocally shown that hyperglycemia is a potent risk marker for CVD; altered carbohydrate metabolism is more common in people with SCI, and is believed to appear at an earlier age than in people without disabilities.\n\nHigh adiposity and visceral fat accumulation are related to insulin resistance, gluco-metabolic disorders and a higher risk of developing DM (diabetes mellitus) and CVD. Sophisticated and high-precision radiological techniques, such as DXA and CT, are considered the gold standards for accurate measurement of the ratio of lean to fat mass, it is proposed that the increase in body fat mass and the decrease in Lean tissue mass are valuable markers of CVD.\n\nExercise has been shown to have good results, mainly in the early stages of BF. In particular, it has been described that aerobic exercise training improves baroreflex sensitivity and that the magnitude of the improvement is related to the intensity of the exercise performed and is proportional to the gains in aerobic capacity (through VO2max). However, in advanced stages of CVD, the response to exercise may be affected due to ANS dysfunction. Indeed, autonomic dysfunction plays a primary role in the pathophysiology of coronary ischemic disease. The presence of a high HRV is a sign of good adaptability and implies that the individual has autonomic control mechanisms that function adequately, that is, the activity of this system plays a substantial role in the physiological adaptations of circulation to changes in brain activity. human being. Therefore, the study of pathologies that affect the ANS can help understand this lack of response and search for effective strategies to improve cardiovascular function.\n\nTo date, there are few studies that have evaluated the effect of different exercise modalities on the cardiovascular condition of people with SCI, who will have a different response from that of healthy people or at the beginning of chronic diseases, but similar to that of people in advanced stages of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, exercise can exert cardioprotective effects and benefit the cardiovascular risk profile.\n\nJustification:\n\nA SCI is accompanied by alterations in the autonomic nervous system that lead to an increase in cardiovascular risk in the chronic stages (after 6 months of the injury). In view of the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, health consequences, and costs associated with SCI, greater emphasis should be placed on identifying therapeutic interventions that reduce cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nIt is documented that intervention with low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise induces favorable adaptations in patients with chronic SCI and reduces cardiovascular risk.\n\nHowever, individuals with SCI face physical impairments and psychological barriers that increase the challenge of implementing exercise into their daily lives. Therefore, prescribing and controlling exercise intensity presents its own difficulties, particularly for people with an altered heart rate response to exercise.\n\nKnowing the effect of aerobic exercise in individuals with SCI will allow the implementation of a training program in a timely manner that will help prevent cardiovascular diseases. It will also improve physical fitness levels, which makes it easier to carry out activities of daily living and, in turn, improves quality of life.\n\nThe National Rehabilitation Institute is a place of concentration for the care of people with SCI, and each year approximately 250 first-time specialized consultations are granted to people with said diagnosis. In addition, there is a multidisciplinary team and the necessary infrastructure to carry out this project.\n\nResearch question:\n\nWhat is the effect of three different aerobic training programs on cardiac autonomic system, cardiovascular fitness, body composition, metabolic profile, and independence in people with SCI?\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe 8-week continuous aerobic kayak training program will increase METs and VO2max, improve heart rate variability and anthropometric variables, body composition, metabolic profile, muscle strength, functional independence and life satisfaction significantly compared to aerobic resistance circuit exercise and high-intensity interval rope exercise.\n\nOBJECTIVES to. General objective:\n\n* Describe the effect of 3 different training programs (continuous aerobic in kayak, aerobic resistance circuit and high intensity interval with rope) on the cardiac autonomic system, cardiovascular fitness, body composition, metabolic profile and independence in individuals with injury medullary.\n* Describe the correlation between the R-R interval, VO2max, METs and

In order to achieve an effect size with a confidence level that was set at 95% corresponding to an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 6 patients per group are required and considering 20% losses, we will recruit 8 patients per group. group with a total of 24 patients.\n\nRandomization: Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 exercise programs using a computer-generated hidden block randomization scheme (with Epidata software) with randomly varying blocks and stratification by sex (female or male), age (male or female). 18 to 44, 45 to 70 years), and AIS score (A, B, C or D). Participants will be assigned to their respective intervention according to the randomization schedule. Participants will be assigned a randomization number in the order they enroll.\n\nBlinding: Those in charge of evaluating results and the person in charge of statistical analysis will be blinded and will not know the assignment of the intervention. The person in charge of carrying out the assigned exercise and the participant will know the assignment of the intervention.\n\nResults analysis plan: For the analysis, a descriptive analysis is first proposed using measures of central tendency and dispersion for the quantitative variables and proportions for the qualitative variables. Analysis of variance will be performed to compare baseline characteristics between groups.\n\nTo know the distribution of the data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be carried out. Analysis of variance will be performed to compare the outcome measures at the end of training between the three groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injuries","Cardiovascular Condition","Exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized clinical trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Those in charge of evaluating results and the person in charge of statistical analysis will be blinded and will not know the assignment of the intervention.

Unfortunately, in human adults, the functionality of brown fat declines with age, and it is one of the reasons for gaining unhealthy weight, particularly around the waistline (central obesity). Currently, we do not clearly understand the reasons for the decline in brown fat functionality. It is possible that the decline in the availability of the molecule Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+), which is central to several metabolic processes, plays a role in the decline in brown fat metabolism. This project will clarify whether NAD+-based molecular-targeted therapies for the enhancement of whole-body insulin sensitivity and brown fat metabolism will be successful in adult humans, which will eventually be an important target for reducing the development of obesity and its comorbidities such as T2DM."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity, Abdominal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]},{"label":"Oral NAD+ precursor supplementation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: NAD+ precursor"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"NAD+ precursor","description":"NAD+ precursor supplementation (Nicotinamide, Nicotinamide Riboside, or Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)","armGroupLabels":["Oral NAD+ precursor supplementation"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Oral placebo daily intake for 6 months","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Whole-body Insulin Sensitivity","description":"Whole-body insulin sensitivity measured with hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp technique","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brown adipose tissue glucose uptake rate","description":"Brown adipose tissue glucose uptake rate will be measured with 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Willingness to provide informed consent to participate in the BATNAD study\n* Must be able to read and speak English/Finnish/Swedish well enough to completely understand the instructions and provide informed consent\n* Age 30-55 (sedentary lifestyle)\n* BMI = 18-25 kg/m2 (normal-weight subjects)\n* BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2 and waist circumference more than 100 cm in men and more than 90 cm in women (subjects with obesity)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to have PET/CT (claustrophobia, metal implants, recent tattoo including metal components, weight \\&gt; 200 kg)\n* Pregnancy and pregnancy related conditions (postpartum/lactation during the last 12 months, or planning to become pregnant soon)\n* Major alterations in the menstrual cycle (e.g., amenorrhea)\n* Use of nicotine based products\n* Hypo- or hyper- thyroidism (medical history, TSH, T3 or T4 levels out of the normal range)\n* Diabetes mellitus (fasting Hb1Ac \\&gt;6.5% or fasting glycaemia\\&gt; 7.0 mmol/)\n* Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (2h OGTT \\&gt; 11.1 mmol/L)\n* Hypertension (blood pressure \\&gt; 160/100 mmHg)\n* Abnormal cardiovascular status (arrhythmia and/or long QTc in ECG, abnormal cardiac murmur, previous history of cardiovascular disease)\n* Abnormal coagulopathy (e.g., clotting abnormality)\n* Malignancies\n* Immunological, autoimmune and primary/secondary immunodeficiency disorders (including or not any active treatment)\n* Virus or bacterial infection (both asymptomatic and symptomatic picture) within the 45 days prior to the study start\n* Vaccination within the 45 days prior to the study start\n* Episode of fever or major surgery, burns and traumas within the month prior to the study start\n* Chronic infections requiring chronic antibiotic or anti-viral treatment\n* Whole blood donation in the last 3 months (\\&gt;400 mL of blood) or plans for blood donation during the entire protocol period\n* Weight change (intentional or not) over the last 6-months more than 5% of body weight, or plan to lose weight during the study\n* Allergy to lidocaine or epinephrine, or other local anaesthetics\n* Previous participation to studies where PET or CT method is used\n* Use of any medication that, in the opinion of local clinician/researcher, would negatively impact or mitigate full participation and completion, or could influence the study results.

Aim 1 is to test whether self-soothing/caregiver-focused and distraction behavioral ER strategies at child age 3 predict avoidant and engaging cognitive ER strategies, respectively, at a follow-up assessment to be completed when children are 10-14 years old. In a completed wave of data collection, children\\&amp;#39;s ER behaviors were elicited in laboratory tasks characterized by threat (novelty and uncertainty) at age 3. Avoidant and engaged cognitive ER strategies will be assessed by youth self-report, parent-report, and interviews with youth after they engage in new laboratory tasks characterized by mild threat. Hypothesis 1a: Self-soothing/caregiver-focused toddler behavioral ER strategies will predict avoidant cognitive strategies in early adolescence. Hypothesis 1b: The toddler behavioral ER strategy of distraction will predict engaged cognitive ER strategies in early adolescence. To provide additional developmental information, Aim 2 is to test whether child age at the follow up assessment (ranging 10-14 years) moderates the relation between behavioral ER strategies at age 3 and cognitive emotion regulatory strategies in early adolescence. Hypothesis 2: Because older children will have undergone more development underlying cognitive ER strategies, relations specified in Hypotheses 1a and 1b will strengthen across older ages. Finally, the Exploratory Aim is to test theoretically-supported individual (i.e., inhibited/fearful temperament) and environmental (i.e., family emotional environment) variables as potential mediators or moderators of the relation between behavioral ER strategies at age 3 and cognitive ER strategies in early adolescence. The investigators expect inhibited/fearful temperament to be involved in the link between behavioral ER strategies and avoidant cognitive ER strategies. The investigators expect the emotional family environment to be involved in linking behavioral ER strategies to both avoidant and engaged ER strategies.","detailedDescription":"Children (10 to 14 years) will be invited to come to a 1.5 hour laboratory assessment with a parent (most likely, mothers). We will gather parent-reported and children\\&#39;s self-reported avoidant and engaged cognitive ER strategies, worded with third or first person, respectively. \\&#34;Short form\\&#34; versions will be used to reduce burden for children. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents provides a 6 item reappraisal scale and a 4 item expressive suppression scale. The Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth - Short Form provides an 8-item measure of experiential avoidance. The extended version of the Children\\&#39;s Response Styles Questionnaire provides a 5 item scale of problem-solving (also, \\&#34;reflection\\&#34;) and a 5 item scale of rumination (also, \\&#34;brooding\\&#34;). Mothers will complete the Children\\&#39;s Responses to Feelings Checklist, which asks about these ER strategies in response to specific emotions, to examine specificity to threat (uncertainty/fear).\n\nThe investigators will also assess \\&#34;in-vivo\\&#34; use of cognitive ER strategies by using an ER strategy interview after children experience uncertainty via laboratory procedures. Children will watch a 2-minute clip from a live-action movie validated to elicit emotion in the domain of threat with school-aged children. The primary experimenter will interview the child about the cognitive ER strategies they used using open-ended questions with subsequent prompts to allow reports of multiple strategies. The primary experimenter will then ask closed-ended (yes/no) interview questions about each of the cognitive ER strategies of focus. Children will also complete two 5 minute tasks from the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery - Middle Childhood Version with established reliability and validity in the domain of threat. In the \\&#34;Storytelling\\&#34; task, the experimenter will instruct the child to stand and tell a story about the previous day in front of them and an unfamiliar research assistant (RA), enacting a series of standardized pauses and prompts until the child indicates they are finished. In the \\&#34;Mask\\&#34; episode, the child enters a room to see an adult RA wearing a mask resembling a disfigured face. The RA completes a standardized script of statements and pauses, finally taking off the mask and engaging the child in a friendly manner. The primary experimenter will repeat the ER strategy interview for the tasks. Auxiliary ER-relevant outcomes may supplement the primary focus on cognitive ER strategies. Behavioral tasks (Storytelling, Mask) can be coded for behavioral ER strategies (distraction, self-soothing, bids to experimenter). The investigators possess the necessary equipment and software for recording and analysis of children\\&#39;s ECG and respiration to serve as physiological indicators of ER. As an additional indicator of family emotional environment, the child and mother will be prompted to converse about the activities in the lab."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Emotion Regulation"],"keywords":["emotion","emotion regulation","reappraisal","avoidance","children","adolescence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"All children will experience brief standardized laboratory tasks according to the same protocol.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":204,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Emotion regulation observation in early adolescence","type":"OTHER","description":"All children will experience brief standardized laboratory tasks according to the same protocol.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Laboratory tasks in early adolescence"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Laboratory tasks in early adolescence","description":"Children will watch a 2-minute clip from a live-action movie and complete Storytelling and Mask tasks from the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery.","armGroupLabels":["Emotion regulation observation in early adolescence"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents","description":"Parent- and child self-report versions of this survey measure, including 6-item Reappraisal subscale and 4-item Expressive Suppression subscale","timeFrame":"3 minutes (at 1.5 hour laboratory visit)"},{"measure":"Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth-Short Form","description":"Parent- and child self-report versions of this survey measure, which provides an 8-item subscale of Experiential Avoidance","timeFrame":"2 minutes (at 1.5 hour laboratory visit)"},{"measure":"Children&#39;s Response Styles Questionnaire","description":"Parent- and child self-report versions of this survey measure, which provides a 5-item subscale of Problem-Solving/Reflection, and a 5-item subscale of Rumination/Brooding","timeFrame":"2 minutes (at 1.5 hour laboratory visit)"},{"measure":"Avoidant emotion regulation strategies to threat","description":"Interview responses regarding use of expressive suppression, experiential avoidance, and rumination/brooding strategies","timeFrame":"1.5 hours (at laboratory visit)"},{"measure":"Engaged emotion regulation strategies","description":"Interview responses regarding use of reappraisal and problem-solving/reflection strategies","timeFrame":"1.5 hours (at laboratory visit)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Electrocardiogram","description":"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) will be derived as a metric of variance in interbeat intervals at rate of respiration, exhibited during laboratory tasks","timeFrame":"1.5 hours over the course of laboratory visit"},{"measure":"Children&amp;#39;s Responses to Feelings Checklist","description":"Present versus absent responses will indicate parents\\&amp;#39; perception that children use particular emotion regulatory strategies within specific emotional domains (happiness, anger, fear/uncertainty \\[threat\\])","timeFrame":"1.5 hours (at laboratory visit)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Family participated in previous phases of this ongoing longitudinal study\n* Child was 35-42 months old for the age 3 assessment (pre-existing data)\n* Child is between 8 and 14 years of age for proposed data collection\n* Mothers were older than 18 years of age at original enrollment (pre-existing data).\n* Mothers were able to complete study procedures in English.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Informed consent/assent is declined\n* Child diagnosed with a developmental disability or chronic health condition related to deviations in expected emotional development.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"10 Years","maximumAge":"14 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Elizabeth J Kiel Luebbe, Ph.D.","affiliation":"Miami University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Miami University Department of Psychology","city":"Oxford","state":"Ohio","zip":"45056","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.507,"lon":-84.74523}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"De-identified and processed data will be posted to Open Science Framework.

Mezigdomide blocks important processes in myeloma cells and may lead to modulation of the immune system, including activation of T-lymphocytes, and downregulation of the activity of other proteins, some of which play key roles in the proliferation of certain cancer cell types. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Dexamethasone is a type of corticosteroid and is used to kill myeloma cells. It is used with other drugs to treat multiple myeloma.

While neoadjuvant chemotherapy has improved breast-conserving rates and extended survival for TNBC patients, this subtype still faces issues such as restricted treatment modalities, low pathological response rates, and unfavorable prognosis compared to other subtypes. Studies like Keynote522 and IMpassion031 have shown that combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy yields a pCR rate of 64.8% in early-stage high-risk TNBC patients, suggesting that such combinations can offer substantial benefits. However, the low immunogenicity of breast cancer and the lack of clear predictive molecular markers for effective immunotherapy result in suboptimal pCR and objective response rates for this group. Radiotherapy has systemic immune regulatory effects by promoting the release of antigens from tumor cells, enhancing T-cell infiltration, and directly killing tumor cells. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitors and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["TNBC - Triple-Negative Breast Cancer"],"keywords":["Triple negative breast cancer","SBRT","Chemotherapy","PD-1 Inhibitor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SBRT+PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Radiotherapy: 24Gy/3f, once every other day; Chemotherapy: Cycles 1-4: Albumin-bound paclitaxel: 260 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Carboplatin AUC=5, IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nCycles 5-8: Epirubicin: 90-100 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Immunotherapy: PD-1 inhibitor, once every three weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: SBRT+PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy"]},{"label":"PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Chemotherapy: Cycles 1-4: Albumin-bound paclitaxel: 260 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Carboplatin AUC=5, IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nCycles 5-8: Epirubicin: 90-100 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Immunotherapy: PD-1 inhibitor, once every three weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"SBRT+PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy","description":"Radiotherapy: 24Gy/3f, once every other day; Chemotherapy: Cycles 1-4: Albumin-bound paclitaxel: 260 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Carboplatin AUC=5, IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nCycles 5-8: Epirubicin: 90-100 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Immunotherapy: PD-1 inhibitor, once every three weeks","armGroupLabels":["SBRT+PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy","description":"Chemotherapy: Cycles 1-4: Albumin-bound paclitaxel: 260 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Carboplatin AUC=5, IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle.\n\nCycles 5-8: Epirubicin: 90-100 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Cyclophosphamide: 600 mg/m², IV, administered on day 1 of each cycle; Immunotherapy: PD-1 inhibitor, once every three weeks","armGroupLabels":["PD-1 Inhibitor + Chemotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"pCR","description":"The percentage of patients showing no evidence of invasive cancer cells in the tissue samples after treatment","timeFrame":"The time immediately after the complete surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Breast conservation rate","description":"The percentage of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery","timeFrame":"3 year"},{"measure":"Ipsilateral breast recurrence or local regional recurrence","description":"The percentage of patients experiencing a recurrence of cancer in the same breast or in the nearby lymph nodes","timeFrame":"3 year"},{"measure":"Overall survival","description":"The period from the start of treatment until the occurrence of death.","timeFrame":"3 year"},{"measure":"The incidence of adverse events","description":"The safety","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 1 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 1.

Three parameters will be analyzed: PImax, P0.1, and P0.1/PImax. PImax and P0.1 will be obtained using a unidirectional valve method and a manovacuometer (Instrumentation Industries, Bethel Park, PA) attached to the airway.\n\nThe device will have a scale of 30 cm H2O with a 1 cm H2O interval, and will be designed to perform measurements at each 0.1 second. Prior to testing, all subjects will be on pressure support ventilation mode (12-20 cm H2O) and will not be on sedatives. The head of the subject's bed will be elevated to 45 degrees and the cuff of the artificial airway will be hyperinflated to prevent air leakage during measurement.\n\nThe subject will have the airway clear of secretions by suctioning with standard tracheal suction procedures after pre-oxygenation for 2 minutes with FIO2 of 1.0.\n\nAfter a brief rest period, pre-oxygenation will be repeated. The subject will then be disconnected from mechanical ventilation and allowed to breathe spontaneously for 10 seconds before connecting the artificial airway to the manovacuometer when the subject will at functional residual capacity. The subject will continuously be monitored by pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram, and will have continual respiratory physiotherapist attention.\n\nFor the present study, respiratory drive (P0.1) will be calculated as an average of the measured inspiratory pressure 0.1 s after the initiation of the inspiration for the first 3 cycles, and P0.1/PImax as the ratio of absolute values of P0.1 and PImax. The subjects will not coached for the maneuver. Thresholds for the 3 parameters will be calculated from their respective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Values more negative than -25 cm H2Owere used to predict successful weaning.\n\nWeaning will be considered successful if spontaneous breathing will sustained for 48 hours after withdrawal from mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe trial will stopped if at least one of the following intolerance criteria present: SaO2 less than 90% or PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg with FIO2 greater than 0.4; PaCO2 greater than mm Hg or increased by 8 mm Hg or more; arterial pH less than 7.33 or decreased by 0.07 or more; respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths/ min or increased by 50% for 5 min or longer; heart rate greater than 140 beats/min or a sustained increase or decrease in 20%; mean blood pressure greater than 130mmHg or less than 70mmHg; or presence of agitation, diaphoresis, disorientation, or depressed mental status.\n\nThe subjects who will demonstrate one of these signs during the spontaneous breathing trial or within 48 hours after the discontinuation from mechanical ventilation will be considered not weaned and will returne to ventilator support.\n\nBefore being submitted to spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) of 2 hours patients will have the tracheal P 0.1 and the PImax measured; P 0.1/PImax ratio will then be calculated.\n\nTraditional thresholds will be adopted for the 3 parameters. Tracheal P 0.1 will be measured in pressure support ventilation, with pressure support in 7 cm H2O and positive end expiratory pressure in 5 cm H2O. At least 3 measurements, separated by an interval of not less than 15 seconds, will be obtained, and the mean value will be used for analysis. Tracheal P 0.1 values less than 4.2 cm H2O will be used to predict successful weaning.\n\nP 0.1/PImax ratio will be obtained through the division of tracheal P 0.1 by PImax, and because both of them, in reality, are negative pressures, the result will expressed in positive values. Values smaller than 0.14 will be used to predict successful weaning.\n\n4- Patients who will pass SBT without deterioration will extubated and receive oxygen through Venturi mask 40%. However, SBT failure will be considered if the patient develop a decreased level of consciousness, diaphoresis, RR\\>35 breaths/min, hemodynamic instability (heart rate\\>140, systolic blood pressure\\>180 or \\<90 mmHg) or signs of increased work of breathing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Weaning Failure"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Traumatic brain injury","description":"Air way occlusion pressure and maximum inspiratory pressure","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Air way occlusion pressure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Air way occlusion pressure","description":"Predictive Value of Airway Occlusion Pressure, Maximal Inspiratory Pressure and Their Ratio for Successful Extubation in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury","armGroupLabels":["Traumatic brain injury"],"otherNames":["Maximal inspiratory pressure"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Sensetivity, specifity, predictive values, and accuracy of Maximal inspiratory pressure, Airway occlusion pressure and their ratio will be determined by ROC curve.","timeFrame":"One day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Traumatic brain injury (closed type) patients who will be admitted to ICU and intubated and MV more than 24 hours will be included in this study.\n\nAge from 18 to 65 years (male or female).\n\nFulfillment of Criteria of readiness for weaning off MV :\n\nResolution of the cause of respiratory insufficiency and MV.

Short aryepiglottic folds, redundant arytenoid, omega-shaped epiglottis, and inspiratory stridor are features of laryngomalacia. Pediatric laryngospasm is a glottic closure due to reflex constriction of the laryngeal muscles that produce partial or complete obstruction of the larynx. When complete and sustained, laryngospasm is considered an anesthetic Emergency.\n\nThe valsalva maneuver involves expiratory effort against a closed glottis in the sitting or supine position with the intraoral and intrathoracic pressures raised to 40 mmHg for 15-20 sec, after which the pressure is suddenly released and the breathing restored to normal.\n\nWe hypothesized that manual valsalva maneuver prevent incidence of postoperative laryngospasm after supraglottoplasty for cases of congenital laryngomalacia.\n\nAfter approval of IRB, Mansoura University, this study will be conducted on infants and children ASA I or II aging from 1 month age- 6 years undergoing supraglottoplasty in Mansoura university hospitals. After obtaining a written informed consent from patients parents, random number generator with closed envelope technique will randomize patients into two groups \\[control\\] group ( C group ), Valsalva group ( V group)\\].\n\nAnesthesia will be induced by inhalational induction using sevoflurane at concentration (6:8%). After that, a proper sized cannula will be introduced with giving atropine 0,01mg/kg and hydrocortisone 4mg/ kg. Then, patients will be seen by fiberoptic endoscopy by the surgeon to detect the stage of laryngomalacia and the supraglottic pathology. After that, proper sized ETT will be inserted using succinylcholine 1mg\\\\kg IV and fixed in place after confirmation of correct positioning , with maintenance of anesthesia with isoflurane. All patients will be given 0.5-1mic /kg fentanyl and 15 mg /kg paracetamol.\n\nA pilot study will be done including 5 patients in each study group. The Incidence of postoperative stridor will be used as the primary variable with difference between studied groups was 40% (50% in group C versus 10% in group V). G\\*power software version 3.1.9.2 will be utilized to detect the required sample size for a study power of 90% and alpha error of 0.05. Cases involved in the pilot study will not be included in the total sample size of the study. Then total sample size will be 26 in each group and by adding 10% to compensate for possible drop out then total sample size per group will be 29 cases in each group. Perioperative data will be tabulated and analyzed using IBM SPSS software version 26."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Laryngomalacia","Laryngospasm"],"keywords":["VALSALVA MANEUVER","Postoperative Laryngospasm","Supraglottoplasty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"INTERVENTIONAL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":58,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group C","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Control group"},{"label":"Group V","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Repeated Valsalva maneuver will be done after recovery from anesthesia","interventionNames":["Procedure: Valsalva maneuver"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Valsalva maneuver","description":"Closure of the nose and mouth during expiration for 20 sec","armGroupLabels":["Group V"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of laryngospasm","timeFrame":"24 HOURS"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"incidence of reintubation","timeFrame":"24 HOURS"},{"measure":"Postoperative oxygen saturation measurement","description":"Oxygen saturation (%) is recorded every 5 minutes","timeFrame":"1 HOUR"},{"measure":"Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting","timeFrame":"24 HOURS"},{"measure":"Duration of postoperative hospital stay","timeFrame":"24 HOURS"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Infants and children ASA I or II aging from 1 month age - 6 years undergoing supraglottoplasty\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Parents refusal.\n* Patients with increased ICP\n* Patients with increased IOP","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Month","maximumAge":"6 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"SAMEH FATHY ELSHERBINY, DOCTORAL DEGREE (MD)","role":"CONTACT","phone":"002-0100-6500748","email":"SMFSHERBINY@YAHOO.COM"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ahmed Elshahat Aboelfoutouh, DOCTORAL DEGREE (MD)","affiliation":"Lecturer of Anesthesia and Surgical Intensive Care - Faculty of medicine - Mansoura university","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Rania Elmohamady Elbadrawy, DOCTORAL DEGREE (MD)","affiliation":"Lecturer of Anesthesia and Surgical Intensive Care- Faculty of medicine - Mansoura university","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29368315","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Kumar CM, Van Zundert AAJ.

In cases of melanoma with poor prognosis criteria, or when it is locally advanced or metastatic, there is an indication for the implementation of adjuvant therapy, which may, in this context, be immunotherapy.\n\nImmunotherapies are treatments that have revolutionized the prognosis of patients with melanoma. These are therapies that work by stimulating the immune system to enhance the anti-tumor response. Their toxicities are represented by immune-mediated toxicities, similar to true autoimmune diseases.\n\nAdapted physical activity as supportive care in oncology is expanding. From a pathophysiological perspective, physical activity is thought to modulate the immune system (by reducing inflammation, restoring immune surveillance, stimulating anti-tumor responses through the induction of T cell proliferation, modulating the gut microbiota, and influencing tumor microenvironment cells, etc.).\n\nThe modulation of the immune system by physical activity may also allow us to hypothesize a modulation of the toxicities induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors. We wish to study this hypothesis in patients with advanced melanoma who are candidates for immunotherapy.\n\nOriginality and Innovative Aspects:\n\nPhysical activity as supportive care in oncology has developed significantly in recent years. However, adapted physical activity (APA) is currently only offered at one center in France (CHU de Lille).\n\nIn addition to the probable impact on patients\\&#39; quality of life, if we find evidence supporting a reduction in treatment-related toxicities for melanoma through physical activity, it would be even more interesting to introduce APA at the CHU of Montpellier.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Objectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To analyze the association between the level of physical activity (estimated by the IPAQ questionnaire) at the initiation of immunotherapy and the occurrence of adverse effects at 6 months after starting treatment in adult patients with melanoma.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nAnalyze the association between physical activity level and treatment efficacy of immunotherapy in adult melanoma patients.\n\nDescribe the quarterly evolution of patients\\&#39; general condition through measurement of WHO status and BMI.\n\nAssess the evolution of patients\\&#39; general condition: WHO status and BMI at treatment introduction, after 3 months, and at 6 months of treatment.\n\nStudy the evolution of patients\\&#39; quality of life during their treatment based on their physical activity level, using the QLQ-C30 questionnaire.\n\nPreliminary study:\n\nWe aim to evaluate the correlation between self-reported physical activity by patients and their actual physical activity. To obtain an objective measurement of patients\\&#39; physical activity level, we plan to work with the CARTIGEN platform and offer a small number of included patients (maximum of 50) to wear wrist actimeters for one week before treatment initiation. We will then analyze these data to determine patients\\&#39; baseline physical activity levels and compare them with the data collected via questionnaires.\n\nThis is a prospective cohort study within the context of analytical epidemiological research. It is a bicentric study: CHRU Montpellier - Saint-Eloi Hospital and ICM Val d\\&#39;Aurelle.\n\nUsing the collected data on patients\\&#39; physical activity levels (IPAQ questionnaire), we will compare two groups: patients who experienced immuno-toxicities without physical activity versus those with moderate or high physical activity.\n\nWe will also analyze treatment efficacy in these two groups, patients\\&#39; quality of life, and the evolution of their general condition.\n\nProcedure:\n\nInclusion is planned at day 0 (D0), with physical activity (IPAQ3) and quality of life (QLQ-C30) questionnaires, along with clinical and oncological evaluation.\n\nA follow-up visit at month 3 (M3) will include reassessment of clinical and oncological status, followed by another visit at month 6 (M6) for further clinical, oncological, physical activity, and quality of life reassessment.\n\nThe inclusion period is expected to last 18 months.\n\nOutcomes / Perspectives:\n\nIf we consider that physical exercise may help mitigate the toxic effects of treatments-an aspect we wish to explore through this project-it would be relevant to introduce adapted physical activity (APA) sessions supervised by a specialized instructor within the Dermatology Day Hospital at the CHU of Montpellier.\n\nImplementing APA in the context of onco-dermatology will strengthen the multidisciplinary approach of the CHU.\n\nCollaboration between healthcare professionals, including specialized APA instructors, will foster effective care coordination.\n\nThis initiative is part of a holistic approach to patient care, integrating complementary interventions to address physical, psychological, and social needs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Melanoma","Immunotoxicity"],"keywords":["physical activity","melanoma","immunotherapy","anti-PD-1","anti-CTLA4","immunotoxicity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with no physical activity / low physical activity","description":"Patients with low score according to the IPAQ questionnaire at baseline.

Therefore, this study plans to investigate whether cardiometabolic health can be improved with increased sleep duration and advanced circadian timing in adolescents with T1D with habitually insufficient sleep. To answer this question, investigators will study adolescents with T1D who get \\&lt;7h sleep on school nights and measure changes in insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and vascular function after one month of a sleep and circadian intervention (1+ hour longer time in bed each night plus evening melatonin and morning light therapy) compared to one month of typical sleep (usual school schedule)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)","Sleep Health"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sleep Health and Circadian Timing Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be prescribed a sleep schedule that allows them to obtain at least 1h more time in bed compared to their typical school week schedule.

Before and after each condition, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation will be delivered to the primary motor cortex to measure the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials and the duration of the resulting silent periods in the bicep brachii to quantify changes in corticospinal excitability and inhibition, respectively.

The hypothesis of the study is that DNS Training will be at least as effective as PFMT in terms of its impact on incontinence severity, pelvic floor muscle strength, and quality of life in women with Urinary Incontinence. A total of 52 women diagnosed with urinary incontinence will be included in the study. Participants will be divided into two groups: DNS and PFMT, and will engage in the designated exercise program 5 days a week for a total of 12 weeks. All participants will undergo an initial assessment before starting treatment, and a final assessment will be conducted by the same physiotherapist after the treatment.","detailedDescription":"Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined by the International Continence Society as involuntary leakage of urine and is a symptom that can objectively be demonstrated, leading to social and hygienic problems. UI negatively affects daily life activities, perception of health status, and mental and social well-being, thereby reducing individuals\\&#39; health-related quality of life. UI is commonly observed in women, with a reported prevalence ranging from 25% to 45%. There are three main types of urinary incontinence: stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, and mixed urinary incontinence. The most commonly seen type, stress urinary incontinence, is defined as involuntary urine leakage due to a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during activities such as coughing, sneezing, exertion, or physical activity without detrusor contraction. It generally occurs after childbirth or during pregnancy. Risk factors for stress urinary incontinence in women include a higher number of births, age, smoking, lung disease, and obesity. One of the significant causes of UI is the weakness of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM).\n\nIt is known that the PFM helps stabilize the bladder neck and contributes to continence control by increasing intraurethral pressure. The PFM also aids in stabilizing the lumbopelvic region (core). Studies show that the transverse abdominis (TrA), one of the most essential muscles providing core stabilization, works synergistically with the PFM. This co-activation has been reported to enhance pelvic stability and support urinary control, modulating IAP and load transfer. In this context, in addition to PFM training, stabilization exercises have begun to be included in treatment programs for patients with UI as a first-line treatment.\n\nDynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) is a neuromuscular and functional stabilization approach based on developmental kinesiology models, utilizing the normal motor development process to assess and treat motor disorders. The primary aim is to restore the physiological movement patterns defined by developmental kinesiology. DNS provides stabilization of the spine and surrounding muscles during static and dynamic movements. Deep spinal flexors and extensors, multifidus, diaphragm, pelvic floor muscles, and abdominal muscles are part of this system. The co-contractions of these muscles increase IAP, thereby aiding. This also helps with stabilization. DNS is based on the principle that the core muscle system works synergistically with various components. When part of this system is weak or dysfunctional, it can also affect the functioning of other core muscles. DNS exercises focus on comprehensive activation and strengthening of the entire core muscle system rather than targeting individual muscles one by one. In this context, DNS training includes the development of pelvic floor muscles along with the improvement of core (lumbopelvic) stabilization.\n\nIt is known that the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) decreases in women with UI, and strengthening these muscles plays a crucial role in controlling incontinence. However, there are also studies reporting low stabilization in women with UI. Considering that stress urinary incontinence occurs due to a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure during physical activity, regulating IAP and improving stabilization could be more effective in controlling UI. The DNS method, which targets lumbopelvic stabilization along with PFM training and focuses on intra-abdominal pressure regulation, has been shown to have positive effects on various neuromuscular disorders and postural dysfunctions. There is only one pilot study in the literature investigating the effects of DNS training on women with UI. This study reported that DNS improved PFM strength more than Kegel exercises. Given this information, it is hypothesized that DNS training may more effectively reduce the severity of urinary incontinence in women compared to PFM training. Therefore, this research aims to compare the effects of DNS training on urinary incontinence severity in women with urinary incontinence to PFM training.\n\nMETHOD\n\nThe research will include young adult women who have been diagnosed with urinary incontinence and volunteered to participate. Participants will be divided into two parallel groups (1:1): the dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) group and the pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) group. Our study will be conducted per the Helsinki Declaration, and all participants will be informed about the research and provide written consent.\n\nIndıviduals will be randomly divided into the dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) groups. Randomization will be conducted using the \"Research Randomizer\" program, and treatment programs will be determined based on this randomization. The treatment program will be implemented by the same experienced physiotherapist, who holds a training certificate in both DNS and PFMT. Participants will be taught how to perform the exercises correctly and receive an exercise sheet containing exercises to perform at home as a guide.\n\nDynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization Training Participants in this group will undergo Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization exercises. The exercises will be performed with the physiotherapist twice a week, while participants will practice at home three days a week, with each session lasting approximately 30 minutes. This program will continue for 12 weeks, totaling five days of exercise per week. The DNS therapist will manually and verbally instruct the participants on how to perform exercises in various developmental positions.\n\nPelvic Floor Muscle Training Pelvic floor exercises will be taught to patients through vaginal palpation. The exercises will be provided as a home program five days a week. To increase adherence to the home exercises and encourage proper execution, a PTKE schedule and a document demonstrating and explaining the pelvic floor exercises will be provided. Exercise schedules will be checked weekly.\n\nPatients will be instructed to perform pelvic floor exercises in sets for approximately 30 minutes daily over a period of 12 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Urinary Incontinence , Stress","Urinary Incontinence (UI)","Exercise"],"keywords":["dynamic neuromuscular stabilization","kegel exercise","urinary incontinence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization(DNS) will perform exercises with a physiotherapist twice a week and at home three days a week.

The new web-based training provides promotores with the self-efficacy, knowledge, and skills required to effectively implement an obesity intervention for Hispanic women. Promotores will build their skillset through interactive quizzes, exercises, video role-playing scenarios, and interactive tools.\n* Complete follow-up surveys at 3 months and 6 months after the baseline survey.

INTERVENTION The first phase of the intervention will last four weeks and will be done in the hospital. After this intervention, if the patients meet the inclusion criteria, they will be enrolled in the second phase, which will be done at the patient's home for two additional weeks. Three assessments will be performed during the study: The first one (\"Day 0\") will be assessed before starting the treatment, the second one will be done (\"Week 4\") directly after the intervention at a hospital setting, and the last one (\"Week 6\"), after the home intervention. The intervention will be conducted in 1-hour sessions three times a week for four weeks, performing different exercises using an augmented reality platform accessed through RGSweb. If the patients continue the intervention at home, a three-session training for two weeks will be conducted in the presence of a patient's relative, who will accept to be the training partner.\n\n3. EQUIPMENT AND TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. RGSweb can be used with any computer or device with a camera. However, our target users are patients who might have visibility issues due to old age. Therefore, bigger screens will be used to enhance the patients'; visibility. Additional screen support will be required to hold the monitor.\n\nThere are three protocols in RGSweb:\n\nTwister Buddy: It has been developed for balance training, which involves a series of levels intended to strengthen the muscles crucial for maintaining upright posture, notably those in the legs. The aim is to improve stability and help prevent falls.\n\nLevels The user will have to shift their weight from one leg to the other while doing different exercises, such as touching targets with their hands and feet or taking steps.\n\nAll levels will start with a calibration phase to ensure the user is in the correct position.\n\nLevel 1 -Balance: In this level, two colored columns will be displayed on the screen, while user motion trackers will also be reflected on the screen. The goal is to align the trackers with the same color column.\n\nLevel 2 - Balance + Hands: In addition to the balance movement from Level 1, a target will be displayed on the screen. The user must maintain balance on the highlighted column while reaching the target with their hand.\n\nLevel 3 - Side Steps: To initiate, the user must have their feet on a square-like target at the bottom center of the screen. After that, a target will appear adjacent to the square. The user's task is to adjust their foot position so that both the toe and heel are inside this target area. Once achieved, the user must return their foot to the original position within the square, prompting the appearance of the next target for the opposite foot.\n\nLevel 4 - Front steps: Similar to level 4, the user begins by positioning both feet on the square target. Then, an arrow will appear above one of the user's feet, indicating the direction of the step (either forward or backward). Once the user moves the designated foot past a predefined threshold value, currently indicated by a slider, the arrow will disappear, prompting the user to return both feet to the square. Subsequently, an arrow will appear above the other foot, indicating the direction for the next step. The direction of the steps is randomized for each interaction.\n\nLevel 5 -- Balance + Hands + Feet: This is the next step from level 4. It starts with Balance, then the target for the hand, and finally, the target for the opposite foot. Like level 2, the user must maintain only the bottom part (hip and under) inside the column while reaching the target with their hand and foot.\n\nCostume Party: This protocol's main focus is sit-to-stand. The levels of this exercise follow different steps to stand up from a chair, starting with leaning forward.\n\nLevels All levels will start with a calibration phase to ensure the user is in the correct position.\n\nThe objective is to dress up for a costume party using a reference shown at the bottom right of the screen. Various costume parts will appear on a bar and move across the screen. The user needs to catch the right parts for their costume and put them on. Once the costume is complete, there will be a few seconds to admire it before the process starts over with a new costume reference.\n\nLevel 1-Lean Forward: In this level, the costume elements move from one side of the screen to another at the user's eye level.\n\nTo grab the element, they must lean forward enough to surpass a threshold value defined by a slider.\n\nLevel 2-Flex Knees: The user starts the motion of standing up by flexing the knees and rising slightly from the chair.\n\nThe elements will appear close to the user's head, and leaning forward is unnecessary.\n\nLevel 3-Stand Up: This level is similar to level 2, but the elements are positioned higher, requiring the user to stand up to reach them.\n\nGentle Giant: This exercise targets less-impaired patients who can perform sit-to-stand and balance training exercises.\n\nLevels:\n\nThe aim is to allow the elements to move from one platform to another following color coding. To do so, the user will act as a bridge between the different floors.\n\nAll levels will start with a calibration phase to ensure the user is in the correct position.\n\nLevel 1-Squats: In this level, the user must move the elements from one platform to another by moving the bridge up and down, that is, by squatting to go down and standing again to come up.\n\nLevel 2-Tip-Toe: In this level, one platform will be higher than the user's height. The aim is similar, though: The user must stand in a tip-toe position to move the bridge higher and connect the platforms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Postural Balance","Cerebrovascular Disorders","Neurodegenerative Diseases","Augmented Reality","Neurological Rehabilitation"],"keywords":["Augmented Reality","Postural balance","Neurological Rehabilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"usability study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Balance training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention will be carried out in two phases.

The functional closure of the PDA can be extremely sensitive to variations in blood oxygen tension and the hemodynamic instability of preterm infants. Therefore, echocardiographic evaluation and ductal diameter at a single point in time (such as during PDA echocardiography) may not correlate with transductal blood flow.

However, intensive control to near-normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) yielded complex results in previous landmark trials. Potential risks of intensive glycemic control, such as hypoglycemia and weight gain, may partly contributed to the possible harms associated with this approach. Recent advances in diabetes management with development of newer antidiabetic drugs which minimize possible harms of intensive glycemic control as well as reduce cardiorenal risks enabled safer glycemic reduction. Thus, this randomized trial aims to evaluate the effects of near normalization of HbA1c with novel approaches on microvascular complications and cardiovascular outcomes in people with T2D.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicenter, prospective, registry-based, randomized, open-label, active-comparator controlled trial involving 5,776 eligible participants with T2D, cardiovascular risk factors, and elevated HbA1c (≥7.0%).

The treatment of amyloidosis primarily relies on anti-plasma cell therapy and supportive care. The application of anti-plasma cell therapy has significantly improved outcomes in patients with AL amyloidosis. Standard first-line therapy typically includes daratumumab, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (Dara-BCD), achieving a complete hematologic response in nearly 60% of patients.The depth and speed of the hematologic response are strongly correlated with organ response and overall survival. An early achievement of a complete hematologic response is particularly crucial in cases of AL amyloidosis characterized by significant organ involvement. The median time to a hematologic response for the daratumumab based treatment is only 7-9 days. The retrospective data showed that the hematologic response in Day 7 in Cycle 1 (C1D7) may predict the complete hematologic response rate.

After the approval of the ethics committee, it is planned to include as many individuals with SL instability as the number to be obtained following the power analysis to be performed as a result of the pilot study. The pain of the subjects will be evaluated with the VAS pain scale during rest-activity-exercise. All participants will be evaluated with the isokinetic cybex device for isokinetic muscle strength of the wrist, grip strength with the JAMAR hand held dynometer, NEH evaluation: goniometer, proprioceptive sensation with ACUMAR and isokinetic device, reaction time with blazepod trainer, wrist pain transfer with a digital scale, assessment of upper extremity functional status: pwre (patient rated wrist evaluation), modified mayo wrist score, DASH, EL20 questionnaire, SF-12 questionnaires.\n\nIn this randomized controlled study, the first group will receive NMES and exercise training 3 days a week for a total of 8 weeks and the other group will receive only exercise training. The evaluations will be done at the beginning and twice in total after the 8-week rehabilitation program. The exercises given to the patients in both groups will be similar for 8 weeks and they will receive a total of 24 sessions of exercise programs with 15 repetitions per day, 3 days a week, accompanied by a physiotherapist. Both groups will also be given home exercises to continue at home. NMES and exercise trainings will be applied in such a way that activation of SL-friendly extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), and abductor pollicis longus (APL) muscles will be followed by inhibition of non-friendly extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU).\n\nAfter the completion of the thesis, it is planned to add to the literature by examining the effects of exercise training combined with NMES on muscle strength, proprioceptive sensation, reaction time and functionality in individuals diagnosed with SL instability and the superiorities, if any, between the methods.","detailedDescription":"Among upper extremity injuries, hand/wrist injuries are frequently observed. The hand is an important organ that enables individuals to perform daily life activities. Hand and wrist problems can cause limitations in the person's activities and prevent the person from fulfilling daily life roles. This can lead to a decrease in quality of life.\n\nn terms of biomechanical properties, extrinsic ligaments of wrist show greater elasticity but are less resistant to traction, resulting in lower durability compared to most intrinsic ligaments. As a result, extrinsic ligaments are prone to rupture in the medial portions, whereas intrinsic ligaments are more prone to rupture injuries rather than a complete tear (1).\n\nThe scapholunate (SL) joint relationship is provided by several carpal ligaments. The most important of these is the scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL; scapholunate interosseous ligament) (2). SLIL injury results in scapholunate joint instability (3). Scapholunate instability is the most common carpal instability (4). When this instability is left untreated, the mechanical relationship between the carpal bones is permanently disrupted, resulting in progressive degenerative changes in the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints (5). These degenerative changes are called scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) and are the most common cause of wrist osteoarthritis (6). In SL instability, extension and falling on the hand in ulnar deviation typically constitute the mechanism of injury. The combined pattern of carpal instability and degenerative arthritis is called scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) (7).\n\nThe fact that the scaphoid and lunate have different articular structures allows them to rotate at different rates during wrist flexion and extension movements. In addition, the dorsal fibers of the SLIL are short and thick and the palmar fibers are loose and elastic, allowing different rotations of the scaphoid and lunate during flexion and extension movements. With loading, the scaphoid tends to go into flexion and the lunate tends to go into extension. These different movement patterns of the scaphoid and lunate result in a high potential energy stored in the SLIL ligament. When ligament rupture occurs, the carpal bones are expected to move to the opposite side due to this energy. Therefore, after SLIL rupture, the scaphoid flexes and the lunate goes into extension due to the pulling effect of the triquetrum through the lunatriquetral interosseal ligament (LTIL). This instability pattern is called dorsal intercalary segment instability (DISI) (7).\n\nUntil recently, most biomechanical theories suggested that wrist stability was mainly determined by the shape of the joint and the interaction between ligaments and capsules. The dynamic stabilization mechanisms of other joints such as the knee or shoulder have been extensively investigated. Less emphasis has been placed on understanding how muscles and tendons contribute to wrist stability. However, over the last 15 years, increasing interest and research has started to shed light on this topic. In fact, more than 350 articles on wrist proprioception have been published since 2011. One of the triggers for this fact was the description of mechanoreceptors in the wrist ligaments by Hagert et al. Proprioception is related to joint stability. The term \"wrist stability\" refers to the ability of the wrist to maintain balance under load (kinetic) and/or during movement (kinematic), and can persist strongly without twisting and becoming symptomatic. A stable wrist does not twist under physiological load and can adjust its internal alignment to become a solid block from which forces can be distributed. Kinetic stability of the wrist requires many contributing factors, including bone morphology, robust static (ligaments) and strong dynamic stabilizers (forearm muscles and tendons crossing the wrist), preserved articulating surfaces, and a competent sensory and motor system that includes nerves connecting the static and dynamic stabilizers. Failure of any of these five factors can lead to wrist instability (13).\n\nSL instability occurs as a result of disruption of the normal alignment of the bones forming the wrist due to damage to the SLIL ligaments. It is often overlooked because it may be associated with other hand/wrist problems (14,15). SL instabilities are usually characterized by wrist pain that occurs during loading. The pain pattern developing due to SL instability increases during activity. Pain may lead to loss of normal joint movements and decreased grip strength. This leads to incompetence in activities of daily living and self-care and a decrease in functional level (16-18). Different factors are considered in the treatment of SL instability problems.\n\nIn recent years, studies on carpal kinetics, kinematics and ligament properties have shed light on conservative treatment approaches (21-23). Different rehabilitation approaches have been developed especially by investigating the ligaments and muscles that contribute to carpal stability (24,25). In a study by Hagert et al. (26), it was reported that one of the most important factors contributing to carpal stability is proprioceptive and neuromuscular control of the wrist joint. In their study investigating the structural and neural properties of the wrist ligaments, they noted that the ligaments adhering to the dorsal and tricuetrum, especially the scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL), were rich in mechanoreceptors (27). In addition, the presence of ligamentomuscular reflexes that cause activity in the forearm muscles as a result of electrical stimulation of the SLIL has been demonstrated.\n\nIt has been shown that especially the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscles play an effective role in dynamic stabilization of the wrist. In a study by Garcia-Ellias et al. (29), it was shown that these muscles change the distance between the carpal bones by making the carpal bones pronate or supinate. As a result of these studies, the idea that further injuries can be prevented by activating the right muscles after ligament damage has emerged (29).\n\nIn their study on cadavers, Salva-Coll et al. investigated the movement patterns of the FCU, FCR, ECRL, ECU and Abductor Pollicis Longus (APL) muscles on the carpal bones. It was noted that the FCU, ECRL and APL muscles caused supination of both carpal rows, especially flexion of the proximal carpal row (30). It has been observed that the FCR muscle supinates the scaphoideum and pronates the tricuetrum and capitatum. The ECU muscle was found to pronate both the distal and proximal carpal row significantly (31). It was noted that carpal supination narrowed the scapholunate interval, while pronation widened it. Therefore, the ECRL, APL, and FCR muscles, which are defined as \"scapholunate friendly\" after SLL injuries, have gained importance in the rehabilitation of carpal instability because they narrow the scapholunate space (32). It has also been reported that ECU activity should be avoided.\n\nStudies have reported that simultaneous excitation of the ECR, FCR and FCU and their muscles can provide global stability of the wrist joint. Therefore, co-activation exercises are recommended to be included in the rehabilitation program to increase dynamic stability (7) Electrical stimulation is widely used for skeletal muscle strengthening.\n\nNeuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a method that reorganizes the central nervous system, causes biochemical, physiological and histological changes in muscle fibers, prevents muscle atrophy and facilitates the recovery of muscle strength and function in patients with central nervous system lesions (33). Studies have shown that NMES applied to the unilateral extremity provides an increase in muscle strength (34).\n\nIn the literature, it has been reported that NMES causes an increase in the pennation angle and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) values of muscles as a result of some physiologic processes (35,36). Especially currents below 50 Hz are suitable for muscles with short fiber length and high PCSA values because they contain long durations. In other words, low frequency long duration selections will be appropriate for pennate muscles. For muscles with low PCSA and high fiber length values, the selection parameters will be different. For these muscles, frequencies above 70 Hz and very short (approximately 200 µsec) durations should be preferred and stimulation times should be kept short (35-37).\n\nShardong et al. (38) showed that muscle strength increased after eight weeks of NMES intervention in patients with chronic renal failure, but muscle 2 thickness and pennation angle did not change. Variable NMES parameters (frequency, amplitude, duration, electrode placement, etc.) have been shown as the reason for these conflicting results regarding the effects of NMES (39).\n\nIn the current literature published by Salva-Coll et al. in 2023, it is thought that there may be an imbalance of flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm muscles due to damage to the ligamentomuscular reflex mechanism arising from the SLL after SLL injury. It has been reported that the above-mentioned ECRL, ECRB, APL, FCR muscles are important in the rehabilitation of carpal instability because they narrow the scapholunate space and ECU activity should be avoided. In case reports, it is described that neuromuscular rehabilitation of dynamic stabilizers of this wrist, which is thought to be \"SL joint friendly\", is applied. The use of an arc of motion called the dart throwing motion has also become widespread in rehabilitation. It has been shown to minimize the load on the SLIL and is a widely used application in postoperative SLIL rehabilitation (40). These approaches have been derived from basic science literature, rehabilitation concepts available for other anatomical locations, and biomechanical investigations of the wrist. However, there is limited evidence to explain the effectiveness of these practices. There are no randomized clinical trials or guidelines in the literature that recommend ideal conservative rehabilitation strategies for SLIL injuries. Given the paucity of literature, it is still inevitable that rehabilitation clinicians intervene in patients with SLIL injuries.\n\nThe effect of NMES on isokinetic muscle strength, grip strength, joint proprioception in scapholunate patients is unknown in the literature. It is important to understand the effect of NMES on the muscles mentioned above as SL joint friendly in order to achieve a more effective treatment outcome in patients.\n\nThere are no studies in the literature that apply NMES to SL friendly muscles in patients with SL instability. In the existing studies, there are studies that include general wrist exercise training after surgery. Among these studies, there were no studies investigating wrist extensor and flexor isokinetic muscle strength and endurance after exercise training. In addition, in the existing studies, randomized controlled studies measuring upper extremity reaction time, proprioceptive sensation and wrist pain transfer power were not found in SL patients after injury. However, proprioceptive sensation, reaction speed and reaction time are very important for upper extremity functionality. In addition, it is obvious that having an idea about the muscle strength of extensors and flexors with isokinetic measurements will shape rehabilitation protocols differently.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of exercise training combined with neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle strength, proprioceptive sensation, reaction time and functionality in patients with scapholunate instability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Scapholunate Interosseous Ligament Injury","Scapholunate Dissociation","Scaphoid-Lunate Instability"],"keywords":["Scapholunate Instability","Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation","Isokinetic Muscle Strength","Proprioceptive Sensation","Reaction Time","Functionality"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups with a intervention group including Nmes and exercise therapy and a control group including exercise therapy","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Blinding was done by ensuring that the participant did not know which group the subject was they were in.

The immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment in HNSCC presents a significant barrier to both conventional and immune-based therapies. Recent studies have indicated that dysbiotic oral microbiota, particularly in the context of periodontal disease, can contribute to chronic oral mucosal inflammation and the recruitment of suppressive immune cell infiltrates. Bacterial-induced chronic inflammation may play a crucial role in treatment resistance in HNSCC. Understanding the impact of microbial modulation on the tumor immune microenvironment in HNSCC could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.\n\nIn this single-arm phase II clinical trial, oral cancer patients will be treated with oral metronidazole and CHX rinses prior to surgery.

The first would be the prophylactic indication, where individuals at greater risk, such as contacts of patients affected by leprosy and who may be subclinically infected with M. leprae, would be vaccinated. This concept is not unique and many countries, such as Brazil, re-immunize leprosy patients and their close contacts with BCG (5, 12, 13). The proposed clinical trial, however, is to establish an initial safety profile in a leprosy endemic region where healthy adults will be included. The second use indication is for therapeutic indication of the vaccine that would be an adjuvant to the current treatment for leprosy. After vaccine safety is established, phase 2 protocols in leprosy patients will be proposed to assess vaccine dose and safety in this population, and then move on to phase 3, where vaccine efficacy will be evaluated.\n\nThis phase 1b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of LEP-F1 + GLA-SE in healthy adults. Two dose levels of LEP-F1 will be tested (2 and 10 µg of LEP-F1) and a fixed dose of 5 µg of GLA-SE in adults. These doses were selected because they demonstrated an acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile in the LEPVPX-118 study, the first clinical trial in humans. This study will establish a safety and immunogenicity profile in an endemic population that will allow the vaccine to advance in clinical development.\n\nParticipants will be randomized within each Group to receive three doses of vaccine or placebo administered IM on Days 0, 28, and 56.

Hypertension is the most prevalent of cardiovascular diseases and its prevalence is increased by the presence of periodontitis. Periodontal attachment loss is higher in hypertension patients when compared to healthy subjects. Both are examples of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic inflammatory diseases, they tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological and environmental factors. The lack of an appropriate balance between these factors results in cellular changes as well as the levels of cytokines with subsequent changes in clinical manifestations of periodontal diseases. Both periodontitis and hypertension are associated with inflammation and an increase in specific proinflammatory cytokines.\n\nAim of the study: To investigate the correlation between the clinical parameters and the levels of Endocan and TNF-α in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) in stage II periodontitis patients with hypertension in comparison to non-hypertensive patients.","detailedDescription":"Clinical assessment of specific clinical parameters: plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL) as primary outcome. Biochemical assessment of Endocan and TNF-α levels in GCF by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) as well as measurement of blood pressure at baseline and after 3 months as secondary outcomes.\n\nStudy procedures:\n\nDetails of the interventions, testing and follow up:\n\nGroup Case (I):\n\nThis group will include 20 patients diagnosed with stage II periodontitis and controlled hypertension. They will receive NSPT and oral hygiene measures will be instructed following treatment.\n\nGroup Control (II):\n\nThis group will include 20 patients diagnosed with stage II periodontitis and no hypertension. They will receive NSPT and oral hygiene measures will be instructed following treatment.\n\nStudy protocol and surgical steps:\n\nBefore enrollment, a detailed case history will be recorded. A calibrated standard aneroid sphygmomanometer. The average of 3 blood pressure values (systolic blood pressure SBP and diastolic blood pressure DBP), will be taken at 1 minute interval, this will be used in data analyses.\n\nFor all patients who are suitable for the study the following clinical evaluation parameters will be measured:\n\nPlaque index (PI) Gingival index (GI) Probing depth (PD) Bleeding on probing (BOP) Clinical attachment level (CAL) Standardized periapical radiograph.\n\nNote: Full mouth assessment will be done and then the deepest site will be evaluated for the GCF sample.\n\nBaseline GCF samples will be taken the day after patients were clinically evaluated to prevent contamination with blood related to the probing of inflamed areas.\n\nThe sample areas will be insulated with cotton rolls to prevent saliva contamination and all supragingival plaque will be eliminated. The paper strips will be placed into the periodontal pocket and then permitted to remain for 30 seconds.\n\nAll patients will undergo full mouth NSPT, this will be done using ultrasonic and hand instruments.\n\nThe patients will receive oral hygiene instructions including tooth brushing using modified bass technique. All patients will be provided with toothbrush (soft), toothpaste (signal) and interdental cleaning with dental floss or interdental brush.\n\nTwo weeks follow-up to ensure that appropriate oral hygiene instructions are followed. The clinical parameter to be assessed will be PI and BOP, patients with PI 2 and BOP \\> 10% will be eliminated from the study.\n\nThen clinical evaluation, collection of samples and measuring of SBP and DBP will be performed at 3 months after NSPT in both groups.\n\nThe Outcomes Assessment:\n\nClinical assessment. Biochemical assessment. Blood pressure measurement.\n\nFor clinical assessment the following clinical parameters including PI, GI, PD, BOP and CAL will be recorded for each individual at 1 site at baseline and 3 months postoperatively. Clinical parameters of PI and BOP will be assessed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks follow ups to ensure proper oral hygiene. Regarding biochemical analysis, GCF samples will be collected preoperative and 3 months after NSPT. Blood pressure measurements will be taken before and after 3 months of NSPT.\n\nClinical Assessment The following clinical parameters will be taken using UNC15 Probe at baseline and 3 months postoperative.\n\nPlaque index:\n\n* no plaque.\n* plaque recognized only by running a probe across the tooth surface.\n* plaque visible to the naked eye.\n* abundance of soft matter.\n\nGingival index:\n\n* Normal gingiva\n* Mild inflammation - slight edema. No bleeding on probing\n* Moderate inflammation -redness, edema and glazing. Bleeding on probing.\n* Severe inflammation - marked redness and edema. Ulceration. Tendency for spontaneous bleeding\n\nProbing depth :\n\nWill be measured from the gingival margin to the depth of the pocket at four points (mesio-facial, mid-facial, disto-facial and mid-lingual) to the nearest millimeter using UNC-15 periodontal probe The average of the three facial points will be recorded as the facial probing depth (FPD), while the mid-lingual point will be recorded as the lingual probing depth.\n\nClinical attachment level (CAL):Will be measured from the CEJ to the depth of the periodontal pocket.\n\nb) Biochemical Assessment:\n\nBiochemical assessment will be done at the deepest pocket at baseline, and 3 months after non-surgical periodontal therapy. Endocan and TNF-α levels will be determined using commercial human Endocan (ESM-1) and TNF-α ELISA Kits. Measurements will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nc) Blood Pressure measurement: Systolic and diastolic Blood pressure measurement will be done according to, 2020 International Society of Hypertension Global Hypertension Practice Guidelines.\n\nIX.

Most SARI-related mortality occurs in patients admitted to ICUs across the country. RVIs alone and as precipitating causes of bacterial co-infections are under-recognized as causes of critical SARI. Therefore, data regarding the role of RVIs in critically ill patients with SARI in Saudi Arabia are greatly needed to fill the current gaps with respect to pathogens, disease pathogenesis, current treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes.\n\nIn the VERIFY multicenter national registry, we aim to determine the viral etiologies of SARI in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. We aim to collect inventory samples (blood, and nasopharyngeal swabs, mini BAL) from \\>10 sites in Saudi Arabia from different regions to enhance generalizability of data.","detailedDescription":"Data on the burden, severity and etiology of SARI amongst critically ill patients will be expected to be of a great value in guiding the prioritization of prevention and control efforts18 and in the design of future intervention studies of antivirals and other therapeutic modalities.\n\nBecause influenza is a common cause of serious respiratory illness in Saudi Arabia, although only limited data are available on the most severely ill patients with influenza, we will conduct surveillance in SARI critically ill patients and perform typing and subtyping of influenza viruses in BAL samples. We will store samples for future examination of predisposing risk factors including genetic factors.\n\nMultiplex PCR will reduce the cost and time to detect the respiratory pathogens. In recent years, the falling costs of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) technologies have has proven to be a valuable tool to understand the growing threat of emerging pathogens. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (M-NGS) has transformative effect in the last decade to investigate and understand complex microbial communities. M-NGS is simply capturing and determining all nucleic acids in a sample which allowed to identify a mixed population of microorganisms. This powerful platform simultaneously identifies genetics materials of any organisms unbiased to other methods that used specific primers to identify specific targets.\n\nThe primary objective of the VERIFY registry is to examine the virological etiologies of SARI among mechanically ventilated critically ill patients in a geographical representative sample from Saudi Arabia in order to obtain a better estimate of viral pathogen prevalence by systematic lower respiratory tract sampling and use of serology among critically ill patients in a geographical representative sample from Saudi Arabia. Contribution of viruses may be under-estimated due to the use of upper respiratory tract specimens only, and late presentation of cases to ICU (at which time antigen is no longer detectable). Therefore a systematic approach using mini-BAL to obtain lower respiratory samples will likely yield better estimate."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Acute Respiratory Infection"],"keywords":["SARI","Critically ill","Infection","viruses"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"90 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Nasopharyngeal swab, MINI BAL samples, Serum samples, Plasma sample, and Blood sample"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI)","description":"Nasopharyngeal swab, MINI BAL samples, Serum samples, Plasma sample, and Blood sample (RNA) will be collected from patients on day 0 (baseline) of enrollment, and on day 14 of enrollment.\n\nSAMPLING PROCEDURES:\n\n1.

Parents were recontacted and asked for participation via telephone or email. Those who agreed, will be contacted via questionnaires in a first step and then in a second step interviewed regarding their own and their children's mental health. The investigators use the following questionnaires to assess children's mental health: Child Behaviour Checklist 6-18R (CBCL 6-18R), Conners 3rd Edition, Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Revised Children\\&#39;s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). In addition, the investigators conduct clinical interviews with parents on their children's mental health and assess children's cognitive competencies using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V).

Data will collect through using the questionnaire that consisted of the following parts: Baseline characteristics of the study participants. such as (name, age, sex, marital status, level of education, occupation, mobile number, body mass index), and theory of planned behavior will construct (TPB) who will receive nutritional education intervention, for a NAFLD diagnosis, ultrasound proof of fatty liver (stage I or above) and biochemical parameter such as an elevated level of liver enzymes will require. An experienced radiologist will do the ultrasonography. The grade of fatty liver will determine based on hepatic parenchymal brightness by ultrasound, and established methods will use to test the liver's biochemical parameters such as lipid profile (cholesterol LDL, cholesterol HDL, Triglycerides, and Total cholesterol). and liver AST, ALT, ALP and GGT). And measuring body mass index will be measure at the baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention among NAFLD patients who will receive either nutritional education, omega-3 supplementation and control group. The questionnaire will modify based on the literature review and feedback of experts, which is applicable and specific to the study also translated to Kurdish language.\n\nThe validity of the study:\n\nTools will be designed by the researcher after reviewing the relevant literature and tested for its content validity. The questionnaire will be sent to panel of experts from different health specialty (such as Community health nursing, hepatologist medicine, community medicine specialist) to assess the relevance of tool with title and objectives. The responses will be represented in four points score ranging from (4-1); 4= strongly relevant, 3= relevant, 2= little relevant, and 1= not relevant by use Liker scale.\n\nThe Reliability of the study:\n\nConsistency of questionnaire will be tested by Cronbach's alpha test (test-re-test) reliability will be checked on that answered the questionnaire twice. A correlation analysis will be performed on the scores of the two tests (observations test and knowledge test), Test-Retest will be done by 10non alcoholic fatty liver disease patients who will not part of the samples.\n\nPilot study:\n\nThe pilot study will be carried out on 10 non- alcoholic fatty liver disease patients to test all tools for clarity, objectivity, relevance, feasibility and the applicability of the tools. It also will conduct to identify any problem associated with administering the tools and measure the time needed for data collection then the necessary modifications will be conducted accordingly. Data included in pilot study will be excluded from the current study.\n\nImplementation of the interventional program:\n\nThe interventional program will focus on nutrition education and omega-3 supplementation ways, which was implemented through the sessions. The nutritional interventional program sessions were administrated individually or in small group and each session was designed and scheduled for approximately45-60 minutes.\n\nFirst phase: an interview session The researcher will introduce herself to the NAFLD patients and explained the nature of the subject area to the approached ones who run across the inclusion criteria and agreed to take part in the study, then will start. The researcher will interview NAFLD patients. The NAFLD patients become aware of keeping confidentiality of information and they complete the basic information forms which will prepare by the researcher. According to Randomization criteria the NAFLD patients will be divide into two groups of intervention and one control.\n\nSecond Phase: Pre- test Pre-test assessment of each NAFLD patients in program according of each three group will expose to the pre-test questionnaire (both knowledge and lifestyle), BMI measures, Laboratory test (liver function test and lipid profile).\n\nThird Phase: Intervention among NAFLD patients The Intervention among NAFLD patients. According to Randomization criteria the NAFLD patients will be divide into three groups, two groups of intervention and one control. In nutrition education group, will interview individually or in small groups.\n\nFourth Phase: Post- Test After 12 weeks of the completion, the posttest will administer to collect knowledge and changes of daily life for all NAFLD patients and referring them for ultrasound and making laboratory test liver enzyme such as (AST, ALT, ALP and GGTP) and lipid profile such as (cholesterol LDL, cholesterol HDL, Triglycerides, and Total cholesterol) in three groups will do."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)","Omega-3 Supplementation","Nutrition Education Program"],"keywords":["Nutrition Education","Omega-3 Supplementation","Body Weight","Liver Enzyme","Lipid Profile","Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":159,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nutrition education Program","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients randomized to the intervention group, will participate in a nutritional education. the nutrition education sessions will be based on theory of planned behavior, which will include three 45-60-minute sessions about understanding NAFLD and nutrition basics, the role of social influences and support systems in managing NAFLD and overcoming barriers and building confidence.\n\nSeveral educational methods will be using such as lectures, slides, group discussion, question and answers, instructional images, poster, booklet and Use case studies or scenarios.

Furthermore, the painful experience of CLBP can be influenced by some already established factors, such as beliefs, self-efficacy, and kinesiophobia. Beliefs are pre-established ideas that can influence physical functionality, pain experience, social functioning, and adherence to CLBP treatment Clique ou toque aqui para inserir o texto. Among them is Traditional Medicine, a practice carried out by some populations that continue to trust their own popular medicine to meet their health demands. According to the WHO, Traditional Medicine (MT) or Popular Medicine (MP) is a practice reproduced in different cultures and based on beliefs, the sum of experiences and knowledge, whose objective is to prevent, treat or cure illnesses, whether physical or mental. This habit includes the use of home remedies, which are based on the manipulation of plant, animal, and mineral extracts for therapeutic purposes. Furthermore, it is important to point out that, as it is a chronic condition, individuals living with CLBP are strongly influenced by psychological factors, such as kinesiophobia (avoidance of exercise), catastrophizing (intensifying fear of movement, as they feel that pain is a threat), and low self-efficacy in processing and modulating pain, increasing levels of pain and disability. Also, in addition to this, socioeconomic level is one of the determinants of the incidence and intensity of chronic pain. In short, although the practice of TM has been recognized for decades, it is not known whether there is a relationship between this belief and the levels of self-efficacy, kinesiophobia and catastrophizing of individuals with CLBP in Northern Brazil. Therefore, this study aims to identify the use of TM and its impacts on the functional activities and quality of life of individuals with CLBP in the northern region of Brazil. This is a cross-sectional observational study. Individuals participating in this research will be invited to respond online to the questionnaire prepared by the authors of this study. Continuous data will be analyzed descriptively using mean and standard deviation; categorical data will be described in frequency form, and the normality of the data will be analyzed to identify the possibility of using parametric or non-parametric statistical tests."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP)"],"keywords":["Traditional Medicine","Beliefs","Lower back pain."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":273,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"prevalence of Traditional Medicine","description":"a practice still relied upon by certain populations that continue to trust their own folk medicine to address their health needs","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"functionality","description":"the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire will be used.

This technology has the advantages of few complications, low technical difficulty, and no dependence on complex equipment.","detailedDescription":"A dislocated crystalline lens, also known as ectopia lentis, is the result of lax zonule fibers causing the lens to dislocate from its anatomical position, which can be caused by various factors such as inherited autosomal dominant disorders, trauma, or several systemic diseases. According to the ratio of the pupil area uncovered by the lens to the whole pupil area after mydriasis, the degree of subluxation of the crystalline lens can be divided into three grades: mild (0-25%), moderate (25-50%), and severe (more than 50%). Moderate or severe cases may manifest as progressive blurred vision, monodiplopia or even secondary angle-closure glaucoma, resulting in a poor prognosis, thereby emphasizing the urgency for effective therapeutic interventions. Preserving the posterior capsular diaphragm is the key to preventing glaucoma, optic capture, and retinal detachment.\n\nPhacoemulsification and fixation of the capsular bag have been described with various methods and devices, such as intraoperative use of iris hooks orcapsular retractors, and permanent capsular support like Capsular tension rings (CTRs) firstly introduced in 1993 by Legler et al6. It is recommended to use a standard CTR when the zonular weakness is less than 120 degrees (\\&amp;lt;4 clock hours). However, in instances of more extensive zonular weakness and progressive pathologies such as Marfan syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, pseudo exfoliation, high myopia and homocystinuria, intrascleral fixation of the capsular bag with a capsular tension segment (CTS), a modified CTR (m-CTR) or other devices such as the Assia Anchor is recommended6. However, m-CTR and a variety of new capsule assist devices are difficult to obtain in some countries. Therefore, how to make the most of the common auxiliary tools such as standard CTR in moderate and severe subluxation to retain the capsular bag requires ophthalmologists to continue exploring.\n\nThe investigators describe a novel technique of stabilizing a moderate or severe subluxated capsular bag which utilizes double-strand polypropylene sutures to suspend a standard capsular tension ring thereby enabling safe insertion of an intraocular lens (IOL) within the bag. The technique has been successfully demonstrated in 16 eyes of nine patients with congenital or traumatic lens subluxations ranging between 120 and 300 degrees."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lens Subluxation"],"keywords":["Subluxated lens","Capsular bag","capsular tension ring","phacoemulsification"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"subluxated lens extraction","description":"This research cohort consists of patients with moderate to severe subluxation who have successfully undergone lens extraction using an improved scleral fixation standard tension ring technique.","interventionNames":["Procedure: moderate and severe subluxated lens extraction"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"moderate and severe subluxated lens extraction","description":"A double-strand polypropylene suture (9-0 or 8-0) was looped and tied to one end of the preloaded CTR, which was then implanted into the capsular bag.
